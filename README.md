# Games Library

Basically my game collection is at a point where a games library manager is needed. I built a basic version of this in Vue a while back in a private repo. Now I'm going to build it in React and add a different feature set. Basically, I want to be able to quickly filter down games to help my decide what to play based on how many people are playing with me and what genres we are in the mood for.

I intentionally made some questionable decisions to force myself to use different parts of React and experiment with different scenarios. For example, the DatTable.tsx file should have the colum data passed in props to keep the component dumb. Instead, I'm using state and hitting a method to get them to force myself to think about state and re-rendering.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Also runs node server at port 4000.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http:// localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
