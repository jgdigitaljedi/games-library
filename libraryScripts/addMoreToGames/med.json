The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.  All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.  When dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.  In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.  There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.","story":"Vicious predators from the far ends of the universe are invading our planet!

B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds. \n \nAt the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard.

She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.  There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot. You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level. You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit. You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these. You are awarded points for each correct match.  When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice. This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.  Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left. On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up. This brings you to another magazine cover. You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover. Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.

The question is; where can the crew of Odysseus set up a colony? The gameplay involves piloting an organic ship to Avalon, flying over areas which the probes have designated least hostile, ascertaining planetary conditions and, ultimately finding a new home for the remaining survivors.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000080,"name":"Bio-Hazard Battle","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd26","name":"Bio-Hazard Battle","igdbId":4517,"gbId":15244,"gbGuid":"3030-15244","tgdbId":20258,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/26/1993","total_rating":63,"videos":["T-Jzp-nLUdM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hig.jpg","description":"Sailor Moon (or Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up video game developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason unconscious. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation. The parts from S.O.P.H.I.A. are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission. Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of S.O.P.H.I.A. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him.

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).  The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000087,"name":"Boxing Legends of the Ring","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Sport","Boxing"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1993","total_rating":64,"videos":["_q0VNbyf7Vw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2w16.jpg","description":"The release for the Super NES and Megadrive/Genesis releases were platforming action games that are identical to each other, but have a few alterations depending on the version.

The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.  Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.  Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.  Gameplay[edit] The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.

The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations.Cannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.","story":"Cannon Fodder is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates - destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion - at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition.\n\nThe player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games.[9] As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000105,"name":"Cannon Fodder","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Top-down shooter"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":63,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qnf.jpg","description":"Captain America and the Avengers is an arcade game released by Data East in 1991.

Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe. \n \nThe game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them. Even though the resurrection of Dracula was a success, the vampire hunters defeated him, and his allies.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000109,"name":"Castlevania: Bloodlines","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":90,"videos":["LRkc0sIJh94"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zrp.jpg","description":"The year is 275 B.C.

The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","story":"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000112,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1993","videos":["8hDFdRavC6k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cse9bfvt7i1pz1qmpydz.jpg","description":"This soccer game offers 32 national teams to play, with none of the players' names shown.

The producer of the game, Richard Robbins, initially pursued the name \"Headbanger Ball\", but MTV balked at a license and Mötley Crüe was added relatively late in development.This game was designed by two people who actually worked on pinball games: Mark Sprenger (artist for such games as 1984's Space Shuttle, 1986's High Speed and 1990's Diner) and Brian L.

For many years, the people of these planets lived in harmony together with the seemingly more advanced Parcerians continually visiting the Senecans. However, something happened on Parceria: something caused the Parcerians to shut off all forms of communication, visitation and activity with Seneca. Over time, Parceria's environment died out, leaving only a planet-wide barren terrain. Hundreds of years have now passed and the current generation of Senecans see Parceria as nothing but a dead husk with the concept of life and companionship on it being mere, long forgotten legends. \n \nOne day, an enormous attack force flies from Parceria and attacks Seneca without warning. Confirmed to be the Parcerian Military, the invaders cripple Seneca's defense forces. Besides being well armed and equipped, the Parceria Military is also able to manipulate the wildlife to do its bidding through unknown means, ensuring no possible escape to safety. The desperate people of Seneca eventually discovered an ancient star fighter abandoned by the Parcerians called The Baldanders. Using its super-technology, the people of Seneca use the Baldanders in a counter-attack against the Parcerian invasion to destroy their main battleship: a large, mysterious warship known only as 'Mother.'","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000145,"name":"Curse","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Curse","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd49","igdbId":4448,"gbId":41031,"gbGuid":"3030-41031","tgdbId":20311,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1995","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dnb.jpg","description":"Based on the feature film of the same name.

However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years.

Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm.

Techniques range from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.  There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.

A freak whirlpool of air and water tore the life from Ecco’s home leaving Ecco all alone. Now he must fight to stay alive, while traversing the vast ocean in search of clues that will help him save his family and return them to the bay.","story":"The game opens with Ecco, a bottlenose dolphin, as he and his pod are swimming in their home bay. A podmate challenges Ecco to a game to see how high he can jump into the air. When he is in the air, a giant waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay, Ecco swims around meeting other marine life including other dolphins who tell them they have felt the storm and the entire ocean is in chaos. An orca Ecco encounters tells him to travel to the Arctic to meet the \"Big Blue,\" an old blue whale revered by marine life for its age and wisdom, who might be able to help him on his journey. Arriving in the Arctic after a long travel through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue who informs the dolphin the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn't know what causes the storms, he suggests Ecco find the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. The Asterite greets Ecco telling him though it has the power to aid him, the Asterite cannot because orbs from its body have been lost. The Asterite tells him to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, and use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans. \n \nEcco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals stored with information. From the library Ecco learns the origins of the storms, an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet, so every 500 years when the planets align, they use their technology to harvest the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex that ended when a beam struck Atlantis from space sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated she spits out Ecco's pod she ate and they make their quick escape back to Earth.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000207,"name":"Ecco the Dolphin","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd74","name":"Ecco the Dolphin","igdbId":5378,"gbId":9286,"gbGuid":"3030-9286","tgdbId":132,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qcyvdk1p51xbf4ca1th4.jpg","description":"ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game with both exhibition and playoff modes.

The controls in the original coin-op version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the \"roll switch\".Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a \"megacrush\" attack will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge.  The player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player.  The player can obtain blue-colored coins known as \"zennies\" from defeating enemies throughout the game. The zennies are used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consists primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also includes a health kit to restore lost vitality, an armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage.

It is unrelated to the earlier Activision game (though their name still appears in the copyright screen), and is instead a run and gun game in which the player takes control of squat cartoon representations of three of the four Ghostbusters from the movie, with the noticeable absence of Winston Zeddemore. Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as \"middle ghosts\"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.","story":"The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie). After each case, a piece of a stone tablet is collected. The three Ghostbusters piece together the mysterious tablet, inadvertently opening a portal to \"the evil world\" and releasing a horde of ghosts. In the end, though, the Ghostbusters manage to defeat Janna, the God of Darkness, and retrieve a mystical gem from the evil world. They combine the gem with the tablet to close the portal, and save the city.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000271,"name":"Ghostbusters","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Ghostbusters","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"id":"smd102","igdbId":4534,"gbId":21416,"gbGuid":"3030-21416","tgdbId":1292,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/30/1988","total_rating":81,"esrb":"E","videos":["Id2K0XoDqZY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25sq.jpg","description":"The gameplay for Ghouls 'n Ghosts is similar to that of Ghosts 'n Goblins.

Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.  By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil magician that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack.  There are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level 1 to 5 twice. Upon completing level's 1 to 5 the first time, Arthur is taken back to level 1 again but this time a special weapon appears during the game.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000275,"name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/26/1991","total_rating":78,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qgu.jpg","description":"Just UpdatedAll SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis titles now launch using the new SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis Interactive Hub, with all new features, UI and Steam Workshop Support!About the GameThe Lord of Darkness, Dark Guld, has arisen again.

By pressing both buttons while holding the joystick upwards, the player will perform a longer jump.The player can procure weapons by destroying barrels and wooden crates or disarming certain enemies. There are a total of eight weapons which can be obtained: three melee weapons (a pipe, a sword and a whip), two throwing weapons (knives and hand grenades), and three firearms (a pistol, a machine gun, and a rocket launcher). The barrels and crates can also be picked up and thrown at enemies as well. When the machine gun or rocket launcher runs out of ammunition, these are still wielded by the player as melee weapons. The pistol, on the other hand, is thrown by the player after all of its bullets are used. The player can drop his current weapon by pressing down and attack while wielding it. If a weapon lies on the ground after a certain period, it will vanish completely.There are seven regular stages (called rounds) and a bonus game, for a total of eight stages. The locations include a city, a moving train, a boat, a jungle, a cavern, and the hideout of the poachers. There are six types of enemy characters throughout the game, excluding the final boss (who has two forms). There are also animal helpers that will help out the player after they're rescued from a poacher, such as an eagle, a herd of deer, and an elephant.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000283,"name":"Growl","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1986","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ihqe27v5xk6o1x5xnegb.jpg","description":"After selection of region, style, and enemies, the pilot is assigned a primary mission and a secondary mission.

You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...  The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on.  Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is \"reset\" and you get up to speed again.

Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy.  In Herzog Zwei, the player directly pilots a flying, transforming mech, a multi-role robot suited for utility and combat. Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (which are fairly basic: patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed. Tactical re-deployment (mission reassignment, vehicle repair) involves a great deal of micromanagement, due to the required involvement of the mech.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000296,"name":"Herzog Zwei","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Herzog Zwei","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"id":"smd110","igdbId":24073,"gbId":11439,"gbGuid":"3030-11439","tgdbId":486,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/15/1993","total_rating":69,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/am37yxsfam3wowihjflg.jpg","description":"High Seas Havoc, known in Japan as Captain Lang, was also for arcade machines running on a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis based cabinet.","story":"The story is about an anthropomorphic pirate seal named Havoc (Lang in the Japanese version), his young sidekick Tide (Land in the Japanese version), a girl named Bridget, and an evil pirate named Bernardo.

Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.

There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life.

Along the way, Bond must battle numerous thugs and familiar bosses.The game is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond, his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens, thus making it Dalton's last appearance in a Bond game to date. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark. It was also the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel. Instead it featured an original storyline, albeit one featuring familiar villains including Jaws and Oddjob. Though the game's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders EA, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, Operation Stealth, included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the licence added for its North American release.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000324,"name":"James Bond 007: The Duel","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sq4oozb4fiqqdcxtd5az.jpg","description":"Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing.

He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like \"License to Bubble\" (after Licence to Kill), \"A View to a Spill\" (after A View to a Kill), \"Leak and Let Die\" (after Live and Let Die) and \"From Three Mile Island with Love\" (after From Russia with Love).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000326,"name":"James Pond: Underwater Agent","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jdw.jpg","description":"Unlike the first game of the series, that was a mission-based game, and the second one, where your character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, James Pond 3 is a standard jump and run platform game.

'Whirlwind' Snooker is a highly realistic snooker simulator. Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it made full use of the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.  Despite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful pot was a resounding \"pop\" and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such.  The game was followed by Archer MacLean's Pool in 1992 and Jimmy White's 2: Cueball in 1999.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000337,"name":"Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Snooker","Pool"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/05/1991","total_rating":63,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dgu.jpg","description":"Back in the distant past (way back - like when “rock and roll” was just rock and fast food was dinner you couldn’t catch), lived two cave dudes named Joe and Mac.

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).  Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000347,"name":"Joshua & The Battle of Jericho","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/01/1995","total_rating":48,"esrb":"T","videos":["eO2sPSY6_uc","OMhZyg2A514","sQexHWFIZkQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s0ljjre9kx2r0ofnkyuf.jpg","description":"Judge Dredd is an action video game for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear and Game Boy originally released in 1995.

Unlike the previous Jurassic Park games for the Genesis, the game features a bird's-eye view perspective similar to Jurassic Park on the Super NES.  The player assumes the role of an unnamed character who must capture dinosaurs on Isla Sorna while stopping rival hunters from transporting dinosaurs to the mainland. The game consists of nineteen missions spread across four sections of the island, referred to as Sites One through Four. Boss levels must be played at the end of each Site in order to advance to the next Site.

Unlike its predecessors, Kick Off 3 had no involvement from lead programmer Dino Dini, and thus plays very differently to other games in the series, having a \"horizontal\" pitch as opposed to a \"vertical\" one. Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release.

The premise of the game is that the main character, Casey, can use masks to change into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as Chameleon Kid (カメレオン キッド Kamereon Kiddo?).  The game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on May 22, 2007; North America on May 28, 2007; and Europe on June 1, 2007. It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2. The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","story":"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000357,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"07/25/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ywr.jpg","description":"King Colossus is a top-down action role-playing game.

The Sceptre of Order rested safely in his hands, keeping at bay the forces of darkness that infested the world. Children were happy. Merchants prospered. Honest folks made honest livings. And nobody complained much.But far across the waters, Arech Dragonbreath, leader of the Dark Legions, looked enviously upon the wealth and splendor of the four continents. With the aid of great magic, Arech stole into the chambers of King Maximus and wrested the Sceptre from the grip of the sleeping King. He then released his evil forces, ordering his minions and lieutenants to seize the land in whatever manner they pleased (as long as it involved considerable amounts of pain and terror). Arech retired to his new lair on the four continents and waited for King Maximus’s certain resistance. The King and his forces, however, offered none. Fearing some kind of trickery, Arech peered into his prophetic crystal to see what Maximus was up to. The crystal showed the King lying in bed, his face pale and gaunt like death itself. Over the King stood a noble young knight with the strength and resolve of great leader. The King was speaking. \"Come here\" he gasped, \"I am weak and breath is a luxury. Please.\" He extended his hand and the great leader drew close. \"You must restore my kingdom. I, too, must be restored. I am tied to this land and as it dies, so do I. My days here are numbered. You must recover the Sceptre if I and my land are to live.\"Arech watched this exchange and quickly buried the Sceptre somewhere on the four continents. He draw a map of its location, then shredded it into 25 pieces. He gave one to each of his 16 villainous nobles, kept one for himself, and the other eight he hid with powerful artifacts around the four continents. Your time grows short, leader.

The player takes control of Aarzak (Kenshiro in the Japanese original), who fights against his enemies using his punches and kicks. Aarzak can attack while standing, jumping, and crouching, for a total of six basic attacks. In addition to his life gauge, Aarzak has a power-up meter that will gradually fill as he defeats enemies. When the meter reaches a certain point (depending on the stage), Aarzak will transform into a super-powered state, allowing him to perform rapid punches and kicks for the rest of the stage. The game's levels (with the exception of boss battles and maze stages) feature a time limit at the lower-right corner of the screen; but unlike other time limits, instead of killing the character immediately when it reaches, it will instead gradually drain the player's life gauge until the player completes the level.  The game is divided into four stages or chapters, each featuring several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk from one to side to the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps. The player will encounter various allies throughout the game that will increase Aarzak's offensive or defensive strength, or replenish their health. The game features several one-on-one encounters with bosses as well. The player must sometime complete levels in a certain order in order to finish a chapter.  'Last Battle' is also notorious amongst gamers for its harsh difficulty throughout.  The original Japanese version ist based on the Fist of the North Star mangas/animes. During the translation process all references to Fist of the North Star were removed - similar to its predecessor Black Belt.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000372,"name":"Last Battle","extraData":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Last Battle","id":"smd132","details":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"igdbId":27971,"gbId":12187,"gbGuid":"3030-12187","tgdbId":4482,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/31/1993","total_rating":60,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dp8.jpg","description":"The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in \"Project 5\", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.  With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000373,"name":"The Lawnmower Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/06/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yx3.jpg","description":"An evil wizard.

Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities:  Erik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet. Baleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\"). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance. Olaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider. Olaf's shield can also be used as a stepping stone for Erik to enable him to reach higher ground, which would not be possible without the shield.","story":"The three Vikings gets kidnapped by Tomator, emperor of the alien Croutonian empire, for an inter-galactic zoo and becomes lost in various periods of time.

When a player completes a race, the remaining time is added to the next race's allotted time. The game also allows two players to compete against each other.  Courses are populated with various objects and enemies designed to obstruct the player. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race, titled \"Practice\", is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race, named \"Silly\", features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite from the other courses","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000402,"name":"Marble Madness","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Racing","Strategy","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1994","total_rating":80,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sidotwjxyqidphoewugg.jpg","description":"Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally.

Countless demons have managed to destroy cities everywhere and the people are all hiding underground. Getting home to the Shinjuku district will allow the player to uncover more of the plot. Mysterious artificats called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts) help to play a role in this invasion by a mysterious civilization.  Players must choose between five characters; each one having different strengths and limitations. The game is played from the first-person perspective and the battles are extremely random. The dungeons in the game are claustrophobic and should remind some games of Shin Megami Tensei. Players do not gain levels after earning so many experience points.

Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts. \n \nMazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger. \n \nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000412,"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd142","igdbId":36947,"gbId":26959,"gbGuid":"3030-26959","tgdbId":635,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"09/22/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qnq.jpg","description":"McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure starring Ronald McDonald.

The game consists of six stages, with the first two stages and the final one covering events from the film, whereas Stage 3 to 5 are set before the events of the film and adapts key episodes from the TV show's second season (namely \"White Light\", \"Ninja Encounter\", and \"Power Transfer\"). The game's soundtrack, composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, features hard rock arrangements of Ron Wasserman's original TV themes.  The game contains a total of nine rangers: Tommy, Adam, Kimberly, Billy, Aisha, Rocky, Zach, Trini, and Jason. When selecting Jason, Zach, and Trini, the voice clips of Adam, Aisha, and Rocky are heard when calling out their respective Zord name as their morphing command. The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach. There are cinematic scenes in digitized form that are abridged from the movie and some from Season 2 of the show. Lord Zedd, Goldar, the Putty Patrol, and Oozemen appear as sub-enemies. Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, AC, and DC are renamed in this title as Sentinel Neck, Sentinel Ear, and Sentinel Ring respectively. Players also can fight the Ecto-Morphicons using Ninja Megazord or Falcon Zord (both by 2-Player mode; Thunder Megazord and Mega Tigerzord against the Sentinels). Bulk and Skull also appear as cameos in the game's ending.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000438,"name":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd152","igdbId":75980,"gbId":21927,"gbGuid":"3030-21927","tgdbId":3131,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/03/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ipbxkcgylzfcm9dupor3.jpg","description":"Mike Ditka Power Football is an American football game for the Sega Mega Drive.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","story":"NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.\nA key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine. While the game was powering back on, the player holds Up and all buttons on player 1 and Down and all buttons on player 2.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000457,"name":"NBA Jam","extraData":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"NBA Jam","id":"smd160","details":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"igdbId":8995,"gbId":16928,"gbGuid":"3030-16928","special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Sport","Basketball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/15/1994","esrb":"E","videos":["3JROy8CY8zQ","MmHq451JNRw","P6WaD41K4DE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ov7vvjuszdc0gtrljnj5.jpg","description":"The first of the NBA Live video games series.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.  The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000505,"name":"Pac-Attack","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"04/05/1994","total_rating":69,"videos":["SEYxgqnK27c"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sss.jpg","description":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, known in Japan as Hello! Pac-Man, is a side-scrolling adventure game \"sequel\" to Pac-Man. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. It was produced and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis systems, and was released on April 6, 1994 by Namco. The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac-Land, and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series, such as Pac-Man's family and a main villain commanding the ghosts. The Genesis version was not released in Japan or Europe.","story":"After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's, for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he takes on disgruntled baloon salesmen and disgruntled security guards to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.\nDuring the game, the player can direct Pac-Man to one of two video arcades where a conversion of the original Pac-Man (based on the NES version, but with 16-bit graphics) can be played. The player can also complete an optional side quest by collecting three missing cartridge pieces. Once completed, a bonus game is unlocked in the arcades – in the SNES version, the bonus game is Ms. Pac-Man, while in the Mega Drive/Genesis version, an exclusive game called Pac-Jr. is unlocked instead. Pac-Jr. is a graphic and level hack of Ms. Pac-Man, and not a conversion of the unauthorized arcade game Jr. Pac-Man. This was done because a Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man was already released prior to this game and Namco did not own the rights to Jr. Pac-Man at the time.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000506,"name":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/29/1987","total_rating":80,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mu7.jpg","description":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.   GAMEPLAY: The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.  The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.  Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.  Delivering the papers The paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.   In Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. The primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.  Keeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.  The player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.  There are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.  Along the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.  A 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.   Training course Paperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker. The end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.   Finish line bug A bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.  Recapping the delivery The next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.  The game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.  Losing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"  The arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.   PORTS: Paperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.  Unlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.  More recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003. A Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.  Paperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.  An iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000511,"name":"Paperboy","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":58,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qxj.jpg","description":"You're a paper boy.

After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has been reduced to desert, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the \"biomonsters,\" a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia's flora and fauna. \n \nKeeping these creatures under control is the job of \"hunters\". During an investigation into such an outbreak, Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, learns of the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet's ecological crisis. The planet is in the process of returning to its original desert state as the climate and biosphere-controlling devices installed over a thousand years previous begin to fail. The reasons behind the malfunctions are clarified as the plot unfolds, relating directly to the events of Phantasy Star II. \n \nChaz and his allies connect the world's troubles to a cult leader called Zio, \"The Black Magician,\" whose aims appear to be total annihilation, not only of Motavia, but of the whole Algol solar system. The heroes stop Zio in order to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. However, it soon becomes clear that Zio is merely the vanguard to a much larger enemy, long buried in the past. The secrets of the Algol star system are revealed as Chaz and company discover both the nature of the threat to their worlds as well as the safeguards placed in a time long forgotten.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000520,"name":"Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"03/20/1989","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E","videos":["rP1slFegNv4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2i27.jpg","description":"Gameplay is similar to the original Phantasy Star, the first game in the series.

Phantasy Star II instead uses a top-down perspective for exploration and a third-person view in battles.","story":"Somewhere deep within the Andromeda Galaxy lies the Algol Star System. The parent star, Algol (referred to as \"Algo\" by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm (\"Palma\"), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota (\"Motavia\"), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo (\"Dezoris\"), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet. \n \nOne thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic. Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the climatrol tower, the bio-systems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need. \n \nThe game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize (but who resembles Alis) is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota's capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the commander, the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission. \n \nThe first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with cat-like features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei's origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota's climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, bringing an end to Mota's Biomonster hazard. \n \nHowever, this sets another incident in motion: the exploding impact causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain's security robots and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler. \n \nThe group boards Mota's last plane to Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion. Upon reaching there, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf's past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the system, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable against the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides. \n \nIt is eventually revealed that Dark Force has been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo's resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends there on an open-ended note, with the outcome of the fight left unrevealed.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000521,"name":"Phantasy Star II","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd185","name":"Phantasy Star II","igdbId":1232,"gbId":4492,"gbGuid":"3030-4492","tgdbId":678,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"04/20/1990","total_rating":77,"esrb":"E","videos":["JVCDO2khgfY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hznnuruplld14i7zu9gl.jpg","description":"Just as you’re about to marry Maia, the mysterious woman you found on the shore, a winged dragon grabs her and disappears.

An intriguing backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000548,"name":"Puyo Puyo 2","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rdqmph7gf4zdgps0itah.jpg","description":"Pyramid Magic (ピラミッドマジック) is a puzzle-platform game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service.

With its comic anachronisms and pirate theme, the game's humour is similar to that of Monkey Island.","story":"Rodrigo is a hero, but in this game it's not as cool as it sounds. He lives on the isle Tol Andar and there are many, many other heroes there. The problem is that there are not enough princesses to rescue or dragons to slay for all the heroes, so Rodrigo is currently unemployed. Another problem involves pirates who want to raid the city Smashville and create flying ships with magical gloomstones. Confronted with this situation, Rodrigo is very disillusioned. Just in time, the dwarf Ramil hires Rodrigo to find his wife Jasmin, who was captured by the pirates and is held in the city of Endavin.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Text"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000567,"name":"Rent-A-Hero","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","videos":null,"description":"ResQ is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive developed by Tempest Software and set to be published by Psygnosis.

A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, Ristar, was also released, which shared similar themes while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.","story":"Much like other games from the same timeframe, such as Gunstar Heroes, the game's story varied between the Japanese language release and its English language counterpart.

The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy to restore peace to the galaxy. \n \nIn the English-language version, Oruto is omitted altogether. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000576,"name":"Ristar","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1987","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vndpo5pahnoezgh6arvv.jpg","description":"The objective of the game is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel.

Knowing the Pig Star had the power to destroy entire worlds, El Zebulos had it placed under a magic seal for safekeeping. The \"Key to the Seal\" would be guarded and passed down by El Zebulos, and his Royal Family. Generations into the future, the kingdom has been subject to attack by neighboring countries which wanted control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights were formed. These Warriors wore armor with Rocket Packs, wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills. \n \nAround this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age. Later on, a corrupt Rocket Knight by the name of Axel Gear fought and wounded Mifune as he tried to steal an ancient book, which contained the secrets of the rocket knights. Sparkster was appointed the new Rocket Knight leader and spent 10 years posing as an outlaw as he searched for Axel Gear, only to return to Zebulos and hear rumors about Axel Gear's return. \n \nBy now the Kingdom is under attack by the Devotindos Empire led by Emperor Devligus Devotindos; who is said to have the power of hypnosis.

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.  The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.  A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000584,"name":"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Simulator","Sport","Baseball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/17/1991","esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nfy.jpg","description":"A terrorist group has taken out the world information flow and, as either a guy named Albert Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them.

The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega-Lo-Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000599,"name":"Sensible Soccer: European Champions","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Soccer"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1994","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/timjydcxsyei4ushe4ts.jpg","description":"Counting Cafe is an educational game based on the popular children's show Sesame Street.

Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit also has the option to attack, cast a spell, use an item, search (if adjacent to a treasure chest), or stay and do nothing, all of which end the unit's turn. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions, and the character's turn is able to continue. The order of the turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.  The player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.  All the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000634,"name":"Sorcerian","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/28/1988","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E","videos":["4B3Taj-GESc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gsm.jpg","description":"A call for help comes from deep in the universe.

They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost contact with a vessel patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols. \n \nImmediately upon beginning play, the Enterprise receives a distress signal, broadcasting on all frequencies. It was sent out by one Dr. T'Laris, a Vulcan geologist stationed on a planet in the Codis Mu system (Codis Mu VI), and in the message she notes that her dig site was recently attacked by Romulans, and that the assailants are still present. The Enterprise responds to her plea for help and sets a course to her dig site. \n \nAs the game progresses, the player learns more about the missing Romulan vessel's mission, and of the IFD. The Enterprise also makes contact with an alien race known as the Chodak, hostile mollusk-like creatures who constantly accost the Enterprise as it traverses known space gathering clues about the IFD. There are also mentions of a now-extinct race called the Senatorious who were the last race to possess the IFD; the reason it resurfaced is because the Senatorious understood that they'd been using the IFD for their own benefit at the cost of all other races, and judiciously decided to send it ten thousand years into the future, in the hopes that civilizations then could put the IFD to use for the mutual benefit of all races. There is one more race, the gaunt Eunacians, which are encountered only once and, after the Enterprise repairs their ship, tell Jean-Luc Picard of the IFD Trials and the Eunacians' intention to participate. However, with their ship crippled, and the rest of their race residing in the Gamma Quadrant, they entrust the Federation with recovery of the IFD, and its judicious use.","player_perspectives":["First person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000653,"name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Echoes from the Past","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/14/1986","total_rating":79,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jjh8brp8ii5nlfvdk4rr.jpg","description":"Starflight is a space exploration role-playing adventure video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986.

The player controls Hiryu himself, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.  Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively.  The game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","story":"Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the \"Grandmaster\" rules over the world.

The events are:  Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.  400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event.  High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.  Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from).

Oh, and be sure to carry ointment for your saddle sores because you'll ride horseback in a galloping bonus stage filled with handy items.

It incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called \"MF\" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player.  The game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their HP and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their \"Load Capacity\" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses cut scenes for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to Ys, a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.","story":"Many years after the events of Hydlide II, an explosion of flames appeared near The City of the Woods.

In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest. The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used. The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000683,"name":"Sword of Vermilion","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/19/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kkggvmy3xb2mc0svuf24.jpg","description":"Yuko Ahso looks like an ordinary grammar school student, but she is actually the Valis Warrior.  \"I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Valis sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process\" Yuko went home by train after that terrible fight.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

It is the second entry in the Test Drive series of video games.","story":"Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent. \n \nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course. \n \nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left. \n \nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth. The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction. Since its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\".","story":"The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth.

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.  You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks.

Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan's earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.  Another draw of Twin Hawk is the game's unique \"smartbomb\" in the form of a group of friendly planes; pressing button 2 once will call in six Flying Fortresses to surround and protect the player's plane, and provide back-up fire. They are easily taken down by enemy fire, so the player must use them wisely.  Pressing button 2 again immediately after the call-in will sacrifice the planes for a more typical smartbomb. Otherwise, pressing button 2 while any other plane is on-screen will suicide them all into the nearest enemies below.","story":"At the end of an alternate World War II, a new European country is formed called Gorongo. General Giovanni of the Gorongo military was infuriated with the results of the war and what it meant to the country of Gorongo, initiating a rebellion against the country’s government that was widely followed by his soldiers. Holing themselves up on Bobo Island, south of Gorongo, Giovanni declared the occupation as the independent state of Fuangania and plotted to take over Gorongo. After taking over the town of Kusunoki, the Fuangania invasion – consisting of massive ground and sea attack forces – started to spread. \n \nGorongo President Bratt ordered a counterattack that focused on the one type of firepower Giovanni lacked: an air force. The special air force \"Daisenpuu\" sets up a mountain base after spotting a secret Fuangania fortress under construction. However, nearing the end of their training, the airforce is spotted by the Fuangania and are preparing to attack. It's up to the player, in the role of the Wing Commander, to fly into Giovanni's secret base and take him and his commanding unit out.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000746,"name":"Twin Hawk","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/23/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gnez34teoaph8mu0xuam.jpg","description":"In the darkness preceding the creation of the world Alpherion, three lights (red, green, and blue) were created.

Because the main characters are muscle-bound brawlers, they have the ability to pick up objects well beyond their own weight (e.g. cars and traffic lights) to use as weapons.[2] They can do the same to most enemies as well. While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile. \n \nEach player has a life bar, which decreases each time they're hit. Some enemies can grab onto the players and drain their life. A player loses a life when his life bar reaches zero. If the hit that finishes a player is an explosion or flame, he slumps to the ground burnt. The life bar can be fully refilled between stages, with a cut scene showing the player(s) punching a \"Power Cola\" vending machine causing sodas to fall out which they drink, those vending machines also featured in most stages as replenishment points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000748,"name":"Two Crude Dudes","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/05/1995","total_rating":69,"esrb":"M","videos":["eF3FmhDs9Q0","zPFJ9RZITjs"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y06.jpg","description":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more.

Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded. Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.  Every jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":1000761,"name":"Vapor Trail","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/23/1995","total_rating":80,"esrb":"","videos":["NcL_kM9twZk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2k56.jpg","description":"By the year 2049, Earth has been turned into a toxic waste dump.
