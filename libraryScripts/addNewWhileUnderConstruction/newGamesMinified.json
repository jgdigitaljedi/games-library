These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. The world in between is where decadence, sex and pop culture mix with violent crime, extreme poverty and the unattainable promise of the American Dream. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw deeply embedded in the crime-ridden city of Night City, going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"manual":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":60,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-12-15","howAcquired":"GOG","notes":"","createdAt":"12/18/2020 07:01 am","updatedAt":"12/18/2020 07:01 am","_id":"e55706cfbb4d46e2b2fc3dcf0e8d970e","name":"Cyberpunk 2077","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","FPS"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"id":109742,"first_release_date":"08/03/2020","total_rating":88,"esrb":null,"videos":["3WSDNB6uRpw","7lD3ryjEKGY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2621.jpg","description":"Relicta is a first-person physics-based puzzle game where you need to creatively combine magnetism and gravity in order to unravel the secrets of Chandra Base. Alone in the treacherous depths of the Moon, your scientific mind is the only thing that can keep your daughter alive…  Play as a top physicist stranded on an eerie, derelict Moon base. Find your way around the enigmatic, terraformed craters by bending gravity and magnetism to your will in order to solve physical puzzles. Will you rush straight ahead and try to reach safety - or will you take your time to gather clues and unravel the intrigues of 22nd century orbital politics? Buried in the eternal darkness of the lunar craters lies a secret that might claim your daughter’s life - or change the fate of humanity forever. Are you ready to face the ultimate consequences of your research?","story":"The year is 2120.  Dr. Patel is the best physicist in human space. She has been studying enigmatic gravitational anomalies in the south pole of the Moon - but she was never prepared for what she’d find there.  Ever since the War, the massive base under the lunar rock has laid derelict and forgotten. Its dead silence conceals something darker than the depths of Shackleton Crater. Something that was there centuries before the greedy ice miners, the idealistic pirates and the self-righteous corporations came in search of forbidden secrets. Secrets capable of covering the barren regolith in lush jungle, altering entire magnetospheres or deploying even more insidious effects.  And now Patel is trapped on Luna, with nothing but her brains and her gravitoelectromagnetic gloves. She will have to navigate the mind-bending experiments left behind by Aegir Labs, while she tries to unravel the mysteries of the anomaly codenamed Relicta.","player_perspectives":[],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"manual":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":13.49,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-12-16","howAcquired":"GOG","notes":"","createdAt":"12/18/2020 07:02 am","updatedAt":"12/18/2020 07:02 am","_id":"efaa363e11d54c56a0a27c6bdf84715c","name":"Relicta","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"id":133330,"first_release_date":"09/14/2020","total_rating":74,"esrb":null,"videos":["rH2KIJVT5Wg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25j2.jpg","description":"In BPM, all of your actions and the actions of your enemies are tied to the beat of the music. Your enemies perform a dance-like sequence of attacks to an epic rock opera. BPM is inspired by retro shooters of the 90’s. It is fast, frenetic and rhythmical.
