      "banned in UAE: Was initially banned likely due to sexual themes, nudity, excessive depictions of violence, and use of drugs and alcohol. The game's local distributor had confirmed that the title will be available in the U.A.E. and the rest of the region by August 15, 2014 for some platforms (PS3, PS4, Xbox 360) and without any in-game alterations. Only copies of the game with localised Middle East covers were allowed, subsequently banning imported copies for other platforms. For example, the Xbox One version was not released until some time after the console itself was officially launched in September 2014. The PC version remains unavailable, consequently blocking access to the downloadable version on Steam. Due to the fact Ubisoft cannot officially distribute their games on Nintendo consoles specifically for the Middle East (for various reasons), the Wii U version remains unavailable (Ubisoft games on Nintendo consoles are generally available as imported products in the region)."
