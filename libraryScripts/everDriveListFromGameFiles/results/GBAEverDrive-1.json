    "description": "Dr. Mario/Puzzle League are recreations of two of Nintendo's most popular puzzle creations. Though Dr. Mario has already been released on the GBA as a Classic NES Series title, the version included in the dual-pack is enhanced specifically for the Game Boy Advance hardware instead of a straight emulation of the original NES title. Puzzle League was originally brought to life as Tetris Attack, but then rebranded on the Game Boy Color as Pokemon Puzzle Challenge a few years back. The GBA version is also enhanced for the GBA's much more capable graphics hardware.",

    "description": "The two Game Boy Advance games based on the 2003 TMNT animated series were later re-released on the same cartridge.",
    "story": "TMNT 2003:\nThe main gameplay loosely adapts the following season one episodes: \"Things Change\", \"A Better Mouse Trap\", \"Attack of the Mouser\"s, \"Meet Casey Jones\", \"Nano\", \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\", \"The Way of Invisibility\", \"Notes From the Underground\" (Parts 1-3), and \"Return to New York\" (Parts 1-3), as well as a level that is not derived from the animated series at all.\n\nShortly after a group of mouser robots destroy the turtles' old home, they begin to look for a new home. Michelangelo eventually gets on Raphael's nerves, making Raphael leave to the surface. At the surface, he is confronted by Purple Dragon thugs, Casey Jones, and Dragonface. Baxter Stockman soon uses invisible foot tech ninjas to capture Raphael, and Donatello is forced to rescue him. Afterward, while Raphael and Michelangelo spar for fun, Donatello analyzes a strange crystal he found in their home, noting that they look like mutated brain cells. Raphael kicks Michelangelo into a wall, revealing a large tunnel behind it. Donatello's crystal start glowing and the turtles decide to investigate. They follow the tunnel and they are confronted by genetically mutated humans. After a few scuffles with these mutants, the turtles find that these mutants were turned into their current state by past experiments of Shredder's scientists. The crystals Donatello found are the only thing keeping these mutants alive, and cannot leave their underground home as a result. They plead the turtles to defeat Shredder, so that no more humans will suffer as they have. The turtles decide to defeat Shredder once and for all, and promise the mutants that they will come back for them if they ever find a way to reverse their condition.\n\nTMNT 2: Battle Nexux:\nThe game begins with a battle with the Foot Clan and Hun in Oroku Saki's skyscraper. The Foot is defeated, and Master Splinter mysteriously disappears. The Turtles chase the trail down to a building marked \"T.C.R.I.\", which proves to hide a bizarre secret beneath its innocuous exterior: its employees are members of a brain-like alien race, the Utroms. Whilst battling these strange new foes, the Turtles are accidentally teleported to different points across the galaxy, meeting the Fugitoid Professor Honeycutt on D'Hoonib, and end up as crossfire in the war between the Triceratons and Federation - both sides are after the Fugitoid for his technology. Along the way, they come across an intergalactic bounty hunter named Slashuur. Said to be the most powerful bounty hunter in the universe, Honeycutt heard legends of him as a young child. Ironically, Honeycutt is who Slashuur is after, having been hired by the Triceratons to capture him. After the Turtles beat him, Slashuur reveals that he has knowledge of Hamato Yoshi before taking his leave. Before escaping the Triceraton Homeworld, the Turtles befriend and free a noble Triceraton warrior who had been forced to fight as a gladiator, Traximus.\n\nUpon returning to Earth and the T.C.R.I. building, it is revealed that the Utroms had rescued an injured Splinter and were caring for him. The Utroms place the TMNT and Splinter in a virtual reality machine to better explain their origins to them. Hundreds of years ago, the Utroms were traveling across the galaxy, transporting a murderous rogue of their species, Ch'rell. Their ship crashes on Earth in the country of Japan. Ch'rell escapes, while the Utroms are forced to wait for Earth technology to catch up with their own, so they can return home. Some time later, after the Utroms have enlisted the help of some humans as Guardian Ninja, the Utroms are ambushed by a heavily armored warlord known as The Shredder. Meanwhile, in the real world, Baxter Stockman sabotages the virtual reality machine, and the dangers within become presented as real to the Turtles and Splinter. After defeating Shredder and his Feudal Foot Ninja, the Turtle meet up with the Utrom Mortu, who gives them a device that allows them to return to the real world. Unfortunately, when they get there, they find Shredder and the Foot attacking the T.C.R.I. building. During their fight, an organic destruction device is planted, and the Utrom escape through their Transmat. The Turtles defeat Shredder before he can chase after them, and it is revealed that not only is this Shredder the same one they saw in Feudal Japan, but he also is the evil Utrom Ch'rell! The Turtles escape the building before the device goes off, but Ch'rell is not so lucky.",

Edgar Ektor (and evil ex-circus clown) has booby-trapped the circus with the help of a crazy flying squirrel named Zero and his fairground henchmen. Only Aero, a master of acrobatics, can diffuse the dangers of the circus and perform various death defying acts to amuse the unsuspecting audience. As the headlining act, Aero will walk tightropes, swing on trapezes, blast out of cannons and plunge off the high dive in order to find Ektor and put a stop to his evil plans. Great graphics and action-puzzle elements garnered Aero the Acrobat great reviews when it was first released in 1993. Now you can re-live the classic on Game Boy Advance.",

    "description": "The object of the game is to guide one or more mice (\"ChuChus\") around a board into one or more goals while avoiding cats (\"KapuKapus\") roaming the board. The mice and cats all move in predictable paths by always turning right when hitting a wall head on, by following corners or by turning around when in a dead end.  ChuChu Rocket!'s multiplayer mode revolves around up to four players placing arrows on the level at once, trying to direct mice into their own rockets and cats into other players' rockets (any cat that reaches a rocket removes a percentage of the mice within). Each player can only have three arrows on-screen at a time and cannot place them on other players' arrows or their own arrows. Arrows would disappear over time, or could be removed by a player placing his fourth arrow (which would eliminate the first arrow placed, thus leaving three). Although a simple concept, this quickly becomes frenetic with the relentless speed of the mice and four players fighting over them.",

    "description": "Just like its Game Boy predecessors, Rayman 3 is mostly a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The main goal is to reach the end of a level, but there are various items to collect which all count towards the 100% completion. Some of those items can only be collected by re-visiting the level with additional abilities which are learned during the course of the game. Additionally there are two 3D mini games involving jet skiing and kart racing.",
    "story": "One night, a Black Lum, who was supposedly said to have grown out of pure evil, named André appears, and transforms other Red Lums into Black Lums to join him. The group eventually gains enough hair from various animals throughout the forest to dress themselves as scarecrow-like Hoodlums. In the middle of the process, Murfy, one of the residents and workers of the Fairy Council, discovers them. André later discovers him hiding nearby, and he and his Black Lums pursue him. Murfy is chased to a small clearing, where Rayman and his friend Globox are sound asleep. Just after Murfy reaches them, Globox is awakened by the commotion. Now aware of the situation, Globox helps Murfy to try and get Rayman, who is still asleep, to safety. In the process, Globox accidentally removes Rayman's hands, forcing Murfy to pick Rayman up by his hair and fly him away from the clearing himself. In an attempt to save himself, Globox runs away to safety, taking Rayman's hands along with him.",

In addition to the traditional side-scrolling levels, there are third-person view races, a shell-glider level for Donatello and a bike race between Raphael and Casey Jones. The game was also issued in a double pack with it's sequel TMNT 2: Battle Nexus.",
    "story": "Shortly after a group of Mouser Robots destroy the Turtles' old home, they begin to attack their new home. Eventually the Turtles trace the robots back to Baxter Stockman's factory, where they save young April O'Neil. Afterwards Michelangelo gets on Raphael's nerves, making Raphael leave to the surface. At the surface, he is confronted by Purple Dragons' thugs, and meets Casey Jones, who equally hates that gang. Afterwards Stockman develops for the Foot Clan invisible Foot Tech Ninjas to capture Raphael, forcing the Turtles to rescue them and Donatello to use a cloaking device detector to properly fight the invisible ninjas. Afterward, they are confronted by genetically mutated beings.\n\nOnce all four levels are completed, the Turtles strike on the Foot Headquarters, where they fight Hun before going after the Foot leader, The Shredder.",
