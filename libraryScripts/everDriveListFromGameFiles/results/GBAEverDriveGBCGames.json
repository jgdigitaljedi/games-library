    "description": "1942 is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up made by Capcom that was released for the arcade in 1984. The goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. The player pilots a plane dubbed the \"Super Ace\" . The player has to shoot down enemy planes; to avoid enemy fire, the player can perform a roll or \"loop-the-loop\". During the game the player may collect a series of power-ups, one of them allowing the plane to be escorted by two other smaller fighters in a Tip Tow formation.",
    "story": "You and daring fighter pilot \"Super Ace\" are engaged in realistic, thrilling and challenging high-flying battles with the enemy. \nOver land, on the sea and in the air, your own skill and dexterity combined with Super Ace's flying mastery, duel enemy pilots in fighter and bomber aircraft. \n1942... It's airplanes taking off and landing on ocean-going aircraft carriers, disrupting enemy formations ready to attack, intercepting enemy air warriors you must defeat by blasting 'em out of the sky. \nWill it be victory? Or defeat? It's in your skillful hands!!!",

Carnby's investigation quickly leads him to Frederick Johnson, who informs him of Fiske's search for three ancient tablets with the ability to unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with Carnby to take the place of Fiske and reopen the investigation in order to recover the tablets. Carnby accepts and makes it his mission to find Fiske's killer. Johnson introduces Edward to Aline Cedrac, an intelligent, young university professor. She joins Edward to recover the missing tablets and assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes to be her father. While flying over the coast of Shadow Island, Edward and Aline's plane comes under attack by an unknown creature. Edward and Aline both jump out of the plane and parachute to the ground, but are separated immediately.

    "description": "Ghosts 'n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons, cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.The game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world's second most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level, or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life. After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was \"a trap devised by Satan\". The player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.",

This Game Boy Color version also had an exclusive character named Kelly, who could be renamed Sumner, and activate a cheat code which unlocks 15 characters, based on the games' creator. Wanted Levels were represented by a trouble bar in the Game Boy Color.

This is also the only mode for which it's possible for a player to receive an infinite amount of points by playing, but the score display shall roll over at 10000.",

Although it shares its title with the first entry in the series, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color follows a different storyline.",

This deity, Quaxet, was imprisoned by the combined efforts of the Mayan, Aztec and Inca cultures, and now some nasty treasure seekers are looking to spoil it all by unleashing the evil. Having knowledge of this, Lara must set out to prevent the disaster from happening by finding the stone first.",
