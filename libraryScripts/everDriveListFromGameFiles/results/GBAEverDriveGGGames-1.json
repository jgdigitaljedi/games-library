    "description": "TaleSpin is a game based on the television series of the same name, released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1991 and 1992. There's also a Game Gear port which is identical to the Genesis version.  The game was a one player and two player game. In single player mode you could choose between playing as Baloo or Kit, whereas in two player mode, the first player was Baloo and the second player was Kit.  Each character had his own form of defense, Baloo had a paddle ball with very short range while Kit had a slingshot with very long range.  It consisted of many stages with three different versions:  Around the World: Strolling through each stage collecting ten or more boxes of cargo to unlock the main exit. Airport: The Boss stages where you face Don Karnage and his air pirate henchmen. Air Battle: You take to the air with Baloo attacking from the Sea Duck or Kit on his airfoil firing his catapult.",
    "story": "Baloo and Kit are still employees working for Rebecca Cunningham at Higher for Hire. She looks in the newspaper and finds that the Mayor has announced a flying contest with a lifetime work contract to Cape Suzette as the prize. She shows it to the others who then decide to take part. However, Shere Khan of Khan Industries has also taken an interest in the contest. The City Official announces that Higher for Hire and Khan Industries have been selected for the contest with Shere Khan's company going first. They successfully complete their run, giving Higher for Hire only seven days to win. Baloo and Kit must now collect 10 boxes of Cargo from 8 countries around the world, whilst avoiding Shere Khan's henchmen and the air raid attacks of Don Karnage.",
