    "description": "Amplitude is a music/rhythm game and is the sequel to 2001's Frequency. Like it's predecessor, players play songs by hitting notes on multiple tracks representing each instrument found in the song.",
    "story": "In Amplitude, the player controls a ship (referred to as a \"Beat Blaster\") moving down a path of varying shapes and lengths, containing up to six tracks. Each color-coded track corresponds to a different aspect of the song, such as percussion, synth, bass, or vocals, and contains a sequence of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is \"captured\" and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.",

During a single turn, a team can only move one of its worms. Worms can crawl and jump, as well as swing by ninja-rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee when the appropriate items are available. The objective of a traditional match or campaign mission is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.",

On the day of the cataclysm, a company of U.S. Army Engineers were in the desolate southwestern desert constructing bridges in an area with a number of small survivalist communities and a newly constructed federal death row prison with light industrial facilities. The soldiers sought shelter in the prison, expelled the inmates and invited nearby survivalists to join them shortly thereafter. Years later, together they formed \"the Desert Rangers, in the great tradition of the Texas and Arizona Rangers\", to help other survivors in the desert and beyond it.",
