# Ideas for future me to consider adding

- add a new view for things like Game Pass, PS Plus, Games with Gold, Epic Games free games of the week, etc data
  - maybe even try to pull in Steam sales, GOG sales, Green Man Gaming, Nintendo Switch Online, etc data
- possibly add a video games new view using RSS or something
- maybe revisit my web scraping idea from GS-Scraper to add at least Craiglist scraping for local used games acquisitions
- pull in friends statuses from the various game apps so you can see who is online now
    - compare games to friends' game so you know what you can play with which friend
- have backend pull in csv pricing data from GameEye and figure out how to combine that with this data providing current prices
