# Ideas for future me to consider adding

- add a new view for things like Game Pass, PS Plus, Games with Gold, Epic Games free games of the week, etc data
  - maybe even try to pull in Steam sales, GOG sales, Green Man Gaming, Nintendo Switch Online, etc data
- possibly add a video games new view using RSS or something
- maybe revisit my web scraping idea from GS-Scraper to add at least Craiglist scraping for local used games acquisitions
