# Ideas for future me to consider adding

- finish my 'extraData' branch where I build a way to pull in new data from my supplemental games data project easily.
- add clones to bottom of game card if playable on a clone (only clones that play original games like the Pocket)
- integrate Steam API to potentially pull my Steam game data in when viewing games
- add 'free' and 'sealed' field to games so I can quit reading that data from the notes field
- add a consoles page like the games page where you can view console data
- better data visualizations. The current ones were what could be done quickly.
- try to pull in Steam sales, GOG sales, Green Man Gaming, Nintendo Switch Online, etc data
- maybe revisit my web scraping idea from GS-Scraper to add at least Craiglist scraping for local used games acquisitions
- pull in friends statuses from the various game apps so you can see who is online now
  - compare games to friends' game so you know what you can play with which friend
- rebuild the whole damned thing. I've learned a lot about React and Fastify since starting this and could do it so much better now. This app was how I learned React.
