You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 2","consoleId":8},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 3","consoleId":9}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Metro 2033","id":495,"genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)"],"total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":392,"first_release_date":"03/15/2010","developers":"","esrb":"M","alternative_names":[{"id":6981,"name":"Метро 2033"},{"id":15266,"name":"Metro 2033: The Last Refuge"}],"cover":{"id":82122,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rd6.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"Set in the shattered subway of a post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 is a story of intensive underground survival where the fate of mankind rests in your hands.

Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Skate 2","id":2586,"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"total_rating":84,"total_rating_count":37,"first_release_date":"01/20/2009","developers":"","esrb":"","cover":{"id":2560,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wkwd1ga1qr9xrudotbsw.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"It's been five long years since your mysterious disappearance from the skate scene, and much has changed in the wake of \"the disaster-too-gnarly-to-be-named.\" The massive devastation left large swaths of San Vanelona completely destroyed.

When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life. \n \nThere is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places. \n \nThe game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the gang's hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone.

A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started. \n \nDefender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game.

A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started. \n \nDefender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games.

Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents).

Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life.

It falls to Vaan and his band of young sky pirates to stand up against the trespassers, and defend this extraordinary world and its people.","extraData":["Nintendo DS exclusive","Nintendo DS exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings","details":["Nintendo DS exclusive"],"id":"nds194","igdbId":392,"gbId":10751,"gbGuid":"3030-10751","tgdbId":6800,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo DS","id":"ccl11","igdbId":20,"gbId":52,"gbGuid":"3045-52","tgdbId":8}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"name":"Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings","details":["Nintendo DS exclusive"],"id":"nds194","igdbId":392,"gbId":10751,"gbGuid":"3030-10751","tgdbId":6800,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo DS","id":"ccl11","igdbId":20,"gbId":52,"gbGuid":"3045-52","tgdbId":8}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20},{"consoleName":"Nintendo 3DS","consoleId":37}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Skate or Die","id":12267,"genres":["Sport","Arcade"],"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":7,"first_release_date":"12/30/1987","developers":"","esrb":"","cover":{"id":65642,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ynkhrx7lltnrx04dv8is.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":15,"name":"Commodore C64/128"},{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":115,"name":"Apple IIGS"}]},"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleIgdbId":18,"consoleGbid":21,"consoleGbGuid":"3045-21","condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":"","physical":true,"cib":"","multiplayerNumber":2,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:38 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:38 pm","_id":"1f164e62f2c54290901142a25f0f9c3e","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ynkhrx7lltnrx04dv8is.jpg","description":"An early isometric 2D skating game published by EA.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts","id":3008,"genres":["Platform","Racing","Adventure"],"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":27,"first_release_date":"11/10/2008","developers":"","esrb":"E10+","alternative_names":[{"id":15388,"name":"Banjo-Threeie"},{"id":15389,"name":"Banjo-Kazooie 3"}],"bundles":[{"id":11147,"name":"Rare Replay"}],"cover":{"id":2980,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/adfbzutybheljksafbu0.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts is an action-adventure/vehicle construction/platformer video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios.

Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars. \n \nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller.

Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars. \n \nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel.

Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive","Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc79","name":"The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":1034,"gbId":7856,"gbGuid":"3030-7856","tgdbId":6996,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"id":"ngc79","name":"The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":1034,"gbId":7856,"gbGuid":"3030-7856","tgdbId":6996,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Halo 3: Limited Edition","id":45147,"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"total_rating":"","total_rating_count":"","first_release_date":"10/24/2007","developers":"","esrb":"","alternative_names":[{"id":12385,"name":"Halo 3 - Limited Edition"}],"cover":{"id":27064,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knh7dmnlhkb8l4rvggut.jpg"},"franchise":{"id":137,"name":"Halo"},"platforms":[{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"Has a three-way folding steel container. \nBestiarum: A hard cover, bound collection of information and art covering the species, cultures and civilizations of Halo 3. \nA relatively small poster of John-117 and the Arbiter. \nAn illuminating collection of original \"Halo 3\" storyboard art from artist Lee Wilson, depicting key moments and pivotal scenes from the epic cinematic production of \"Halo.\" \nAn extra disc that contains exclusive, behind-the-scenes footage and videos, a high-definition \"Making of 'Halo 3',\" a documentary showcasing the Bungie team and its effort to create the most anticipated title in the industry's history, numerous high-definition featurettes documenting the creative design processes involved in developing the game; and a look at some early game concepts and their evolution through the game's development. \nThe extra disc contains an audio-visual calibration tool."},"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleIgdbId":12,"consoleGbid":20,"consoleGbGuid":"3045-20","condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":"6.64","physical":true,"cib":true,"multiplayerNumber":2,"datePurchased":"2019-02-09","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:16 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:16 pm","_id":"d16d26e1a52d4a749b180518ac968bbf","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knh7dmnlhkb8l4rvggut.jpg","description":"Has a three-way folding steel container. \nBestiarum: A hard cover, bound collection of information and art covering the species, cultures and civilizations of Halo 3. \nA relatively small poster of John-117 and the Arbiter. \nAn illuminating collection of original \"Halo 3\" storyboard art from artist Lee Wilson, depicting key moments and pivotal scenes from the epic cinematic production of \"Halo.\" \nAn extra disc that contains exclusive, behind-the-scenes footage and videos, a high-definition \"Making of 'Halo 3',\" a documentary showcasing the Bungie team and its effort to create the most anticipated title in the industry's history, numerous high-definition featurettes documenting the creative design processes involved in developing the game; and a look at some early game concepts and their evolution through the game's development. \nThe extra disc contains an audio-visual calibration tool.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12}]},{"igdb":{"name":"HITMAN","id":11157,"genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":281,"first_release_date":"03/10/2016","developers":"","esrb":"M","alternative_names":[{"id":12024,"name":"Hitman 6"},{"id":12816,"name":"HITMAN"},{"id":12817,"name":"Hitman"}],"bundles":[{"id":96140,"name":"HITMAN: Definitive Edition"}],"cover":{"id":77403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1nq3.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"summary":"Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story.

Fortunately, the optional strategic view gives you a god’s-eye vantage on battle. Time stops while you plan in this view, but if that’s not your style, you can just barrel ahead, crossbows blazing.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour","id":23596,"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"total_rating":82,"total_rating_count":22,"first_release_date":"10/10/2016","developers":"","esrb":"M","cover":{"id":80559,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1q5r.jpg"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"id":1461,"offlinecoopmax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"id":7296},{"id":8061,"offlinecoopmax":0,"offlinemax":0}],"platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":45,"name":"PlayStation Network"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"summary":"Frag like it’s 1996 – this time with even more asses to kick!

Packed to the gills with exploration, creative power-ups, and wicked enemies, Metroid Prime is a first-person adventure worthy of the Metroid stamp.

It has lead character Samus Aran, a bounty hunter by trade, chasing down the evil Space Pirates.

Jak, the only prisoner to survive the experiments, is altered mentally and physically, turning him (temporarily under random and controlled spasms) into a deadly monster.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights","id":7024,"genres":["Racing"],"total_rating":68,"total_rating_count":10,"first_release_date":"09/16/2007","developers":"","esrb":"","alternative_names":[{"id":15187,"name":"Juiced 2"}],"cover":{"id":78914,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ow2.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"summary":"Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights is a racing video game for various platforms.

Players experience dizzying perspective shifts as they run upside down through wild alien worlds that need to be seen to be believed. Whether you're surfing on a ray across an ocean in the clouds, rolling on a ball through a treacherous garden, or floating in a bubble over a poisonous swamp, there's no limit to the cosmic challenges you'll encounter! \n \n* Shake it! Controlling Mario is as simple as can be with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Move Mario with the Control Stick and shake the Wii Remote to perform a spin move or cue Ring Stars that launch you to and from planetary objects. You can even point at bits of stardust to collect them or latch onto Beam Stars to blaze a magnetic trail through the heavens. \n \n* Mario can run, tiptoe, jump, triple-jump, backflip, and long-jump, but what he'll do most is spin. By shaking the Wii Remote, players make Mario spin around with fists outstretched, allowing him to pummel enemies and cue Star Rings that launch him from planet to planet. \n \n* He can also find plenty of power-ups: A Bee Mushroom turns him into Bee Mario, allowing him to fly for short periods of time and cling to honeycombs.
