Stand up to the cult’s leader, Joseph Seed and the Heralds, and spark the fires of resistance that will liberate the besieged community.    In this expansive world, your limits and creativity will be tested against the biggest and most ruthless baddest enemy Far Cry has ever seen. It’ll be wild and it’ll get weird, but as long as you keep your wits about you, the residents of Hope County can rest assured knowing you’re their beacon of hope.","story":"The game is set in the fictional Hope County, Montana, where a preacher named Joseph Seed has risen to prominence in the region. Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an \"inevitable collapse\" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the federal government for help. When an attempt to arrest Seed ends with the deaths of several lawmen, the player is swept into the armed conflict between Eden's Gate and the remaining Hope County residents who are organizing themselves into a resistance movement. The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed. Seed has assumed the title of \"the Father\" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of his siblings, known as \"the Heralds\": Jacob, a former military officer that oversees their armed soldiers; John, a lawyer that has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate; and Faith, who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to believe and trust in her older brother. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"manual":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":8.99,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-12-18","howAcquired":"Epic Games","notes":"Gold Edition","createdAt":"12/19/2020 07:10 am","updatedAt":"12/19/2020 07:10 am","_id":"5bb4147a0cfc4257afa546aa7cb948c0","name":"Far Cry 5","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure","FPS","Open world"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure, FPS, Open world","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"id":1877,"first_release_date":"12/09/2020","total_rating":77,"esrb":"M","videos":["6eS7CX5zkj0","qIcTM8WXFjk","FknHjl7eQ6o","9cOHWnklYGw","vjF9GgrY9c0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mjs.jpg","description":"Cyberpunk 2077 is a role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt.

The game was developed by the original game designer, Paul Cuisset, with his studio, VectorCell, and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on August 21, 2013 on Xbox Live Arcade.","story":"The game begins with the protagonist, who tried to escape from Cyborgs using a jetbike. Unfortunately his vehicle got severely damaged and crashes in a jungle of Titan. He wakes up after a while, finds a gun and retrieves a holocube later on. His own hologram tells he is Conrad B. Hart, and he has to go find Ian in New Washington, telling he's not safe. After a little journey in the jungle, he meets Bolton, and asks to find his teleporter for medical assistance. After retrieving the teleporter, he teleports as he leaves his own ID card. After venturing for a while, Conrad meets Joe, he tells that New Washington is down the hole behind him, but an Anti-Gravity Belt is needed. To have it, he asks for several Grenada fruits. After swapping what they both want, Conrad jumps into the hole and activates the belt to safely arrive in New Washington.Near Ian's place, he overhears a Cyborg interrogating him about a neurophage. After saving him, he gives a part of his memory back and gives a force field to protect him from bullets. Conrad then checks his GBI Virtual Reality with a virtual professor, who mocks him and tells him his own cryptic location. He finds a Memory Flash at the place, to find out about a deal with aliens in disguise in Death Tower. Conrad asks Joe a new identity for the Death Tower TV show. Joe tells the cost is 1500 credits, and points out the Administration Center to get a Work Permit for a salary. He uses Bolton's ID card to get a Work Permit. After doing his first job, he gets another Memory Flash, about a meeting between him and the real professor, telling him the Earth is being quietly invaded by aliens nicknamed Morphs. He then talks about a neurophage that he made to destroy them all. As he performs other jobs, he finds other pieces of his memory back as well as instructions to find the neurophage and its activator. With all the salary he got from performing jobs, he buys what he wanted from Joe, and enters the Death Tower TV show as Jay Carpenter.After winning the show and getting a ticket to Earth, Conrad talks to the announcer about finishing up the deal. The disguised morph then reveals they have the new senator and Sonia, Conrad's girlfriend, and awaits them to be absorbed by The Mind. After killing the announcer, he uses the ticket to Earth to save Sonia and the planet.Eventually, he is arrested in Earth's spaceport by corrupted cyborg cops, but manages to get out. He meets Ian again, who says that erasing his own memory to fool them didn't work, reminding him that he gave his first flashback, and reveals that he's a Morph, and the Morphs' goal: To perfect humanity as being a powerful entity. He gives to Conrad his painful last Flashback: showing that he had a very risky plan to go to the Morphs' homeworld. He then drives a jetbike, and asks Bolton where is the senator, and talks about the Paradise Club. When he goes there, he witnesses a meeting between the senator and the Morphs, who absorbed him, and talks about the Earth's colonisation. The vent where he stands for fell by his weight and is imprisoned by them. He manages to escape and meets Ian once more, and kills him. He finds a teleporter which leads him to their homeworld.After being teleported, he frees the professor from his prison, and tells Conrad to get rid of an auxiliary brain so he can save Sonia. After that, he tells him to destroy The Mind, and use the neurophage in the planet's core. As he meets The Mind, it tries to persuade Conrad into being absorbed by him, only to get mocked at, and says he prefers being himself. After destroying it, Conrad releases the neurophage. As he tells Sonia that he's sorry, the professor tells Conrad to run as there is a spacecraft not far away.Conrad manages to leave the Morph Planet alive as it explodes with the spacecraft. He tries to find where he is in the map, only to find out that his position is unknown. Unhappy, as he goes to his room, his holocube shows a hologram of Conrad congratulating him. Conrad then enters into suspended animation as the spacecraft goes. The credits shows the cutscenes, including one when the suspended animation ends as he wakes up. The post-credits cutscene is a discussion between some of the characters, with Sonia feeling that Conrad is still alive.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"id":19833,"manual":false,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":2,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-11-27","howAcquired":"GOG","notes":"","createdAt":"12/01/2020 05:59 am","updatedAt":"12/01/2020 05:59 am","_id":"ca1be62e63134eec85c0e175fbb9adf1","name":"Flashback","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"12/02/1996","total_rating":67,"esrb":"T","videos":["3yjqaeO14c4","8arRt8aDS0M","x8xNSgSof2E"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25xv.jpg","description":"As Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance struggle to defeat Darth Vader and the Empire, a new threat arises.

The game also features a unique rollover bonus with an Atari Inc. logo on the playfield; hitting the logo four times results in an extra ball. Most of the game play involves learning how to perform specific functions, such as launching the ball or activating the flippers, with the Atari 2600 joystick. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield.

Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features.","story":"Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. \nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. \nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. \nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. \nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. \nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. \nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":8,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-10-01","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","updatedAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","_id":"4b4fd6f0f2544f65b08d3bebc24a31d5","name":"Battlefield 4","extraData":["banned in China: Banned for discrediting China's national image as well as threatening national security.

These elves had a major problem, though. Their prized mushroom garden was infested with pests--a giant Centipede, a poison-spreading scorpion, a mischief-making spider, and a pesky flea. The good elves tried everything they could to rid their garden of these bugs. But nothing worked. \n \n \nOne day, an elf named Oliver was hacking away at a poisoned mushroom in the garden. Suddenly, he saw an unusual stick gleaming in the dirt. Just as Oliver picked up the stick, a spider jumped out from behind a mushroom and rushed at him. When Oliver waved his hands wildly to try to scare the spider away, sparks flew from his stick and the spider disappeared! \n \n \n\"How did that happen?\" Oliver wondered out loud. \"Could this be a magic wand?\" \n \n \nSoon Oliver had another chance to try the wand. When the scorpion scurried across a row of mushroom, poisoning every mushroom it touched, Oliver pointed the wand at the scorpion and shouted, \"Be gone!\" Instantly, the scorpion disappeared and the poisoned mushrooms were transformed back into normal mushrooms. \n \n \n\"This is great! This is the tool we need to clean up our mushroom garden\" Oliver shouted ecstatically. \n \n \nWith his new found magic wand, Oliver hid behind a mushroom. \"OK, you great big Centipede,\" he said. \"Come out wherever you are.

It was followed by a successful sequel called Galaga in 1981 and two less known sequels called Gaplus in 1984 and Galaga '88 in 1987.

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.1,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-09-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/18/2020 05:07 pm","updatedAt":"09/18/2020 05:07 pm","_id":"02c2460e36524aa4a21501131a0e42a9","name":"Pac-Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"id":2750,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Strategy, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"09/18/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-09-18T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 5200","id":"20212","price":4.99,"name":"Pac-Man","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1982","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yo3ea8houk60kuhis6wl.jpg","description":"Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":29.41,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-09-12","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","updatedAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","_id":"db24c073581847fd992221cd2a99fdca","name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"id":5565,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"sega","purchaseDate":"09/12/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-09-12T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Genesis","id":"9046","price":35.65,"name":"Golden Axe","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/30/1983","total_rating":47,"esrb":"E","videos":["zlNqtY76ho0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/z6xrk4qkqerfdrvsgkin.jpg","description":"The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling.

Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counter-attack, prompting the ISA evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions with more powerful weapons appear, the ISA find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. The player reassumes the role of Sev, a surviving member of the Special Forces unit Alpha Squad, who must fight against vindictive, merciless enemy forces in a desperate attempt to escape Helghan alive.","story":"The game begins in medias res from the point of view of two Helghast soldiers who have arrived at Stahl Arms Corporation, Jorhan Stahl's weapons factory. The two are taken to a room where the captured Jason Narville's execution is about to be broadcast by Stahl across Helghan. As the two soldiers are about to execute Narville, they reveal themselves as Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko and Rico Velasquez and the scene cuts back six months earlier, immediately following the events of Killzone 2. \nSev and Rico regroup with Captain Jason Narville outside Scolar Visari's palace and they begin their evacuation towards the remaining ISA ships on Helghan. They face heavy resistance from organised Helghan troops led by Admiral Orlock, whose battle plan is well received by most of the senate except for Jorhan Stahl, the chairman of Stahl Arms, the largest weapons manufacturer on Helghan. From the outset, the animosity between the two parties is made apparent. Rico receives a transmission from Jammer and separates from the group to rescue her squad who have encountered heavy resistance. Due to a poorly-engineered evacuation a few ISA ships are unable to depart, separating Rico from Sev and the rest of the ISA forces, and leaving all of them marooned on Helghan. \nJumping six months forward, the Helghast senate expresses their disappointment with Orlock's search for the remaining ISA forces, since he had initially promised that they would be dead within the hour. One of the senators suggests to relieve Orlock, and replace him with Stahl, but is refused. As a result Stahl refuses to deliver his weapon prototype and other resources (Stahl Arms itself) to the military as long as Orlock is on charge, citing the Admiral as incompetent. Stahl organizes his private army to hunt down the ISA who are hiding in a Helghast jungle. Narville dispatches Sev along with a soldier named Kowalski to retrieve a satellite uplink in order to contact the Vektan government. Upon doing so, Earth Command informs Sev and Narville that the ISA has agreed to a cease-fire and that they are to surrender so their release can be negotiated. The Helghast soon track the ISA in the jungle, ending with their capture and the death of Kowalski after a brutal battle. \nRico and his men, including Jammer, who have been separated from the main group for six months, are able to rescue Sev, who convinces them to save Narville and the rest of the captured ISA forces. They track them to Stahl's base and discover a horrifying new weapon using irradiated Petrusite, a compound that causes its victims to explode. Disguised as Narville's executioners, Sev and Rico rescue Narville in addition to freeing some of their men who were held as prisoners of war and used as test subjects for Stahl's new weapons. On their way out, Rico and Sev discover Stahl's plan to destroy Earth, the most powerful military force and the leading imperial force which colonized all the other worlds; their downfall would allow the Helghast to dominate and reclaim all the other colonies. \nEmbarrassed by Stahl's failure to execute Narville, the senate chooses to vote Orlock as Helghan's new Autarch and he orders Stahl to transfer his new weapons to the Helghast military. Stahl is made to confront Orlock at the space station where he plans to assassinate Stahl. After a grueling ground battle with the Helghast forces, remaining ISA soldiers arrive at the orbital elevator and use it to ride up to the space station. \nOn the station, Stahl turns on Orlock, destroying his fleet and murdering him after a brief duel, and makes preparations to bombard Earth. The remaining ISA forces hijack two fighters and Sev manages to shoot down Stahl's cruiser. Unwilling to let Stahl escape the cruiser, he drops a nuke on the falling cruiser, detonating the Petrusite weapons it was carrying above Helghan's atmosphere. The Petrusite engulfs the entire planet and wipes out almost everything on its surface. Jammer then reports that Helghan has gone dark, with not a single communication being heard. Sev contemplates on the many lives on the planet obliterated by the Petrusite. \nIn a mid-credits scene, two Helghast soldiers are searching through some ruins when they come across an escape pod. Though the occupant's identity is not revealed, both soldiers bow and say, \"Welcome home, sir,\" implying that Stahl survived and managed to escape his cruiser before it was destroyed.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-09-08","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"09/09/2020 06:28 am","updatedAt":"09/09/2020 06:28 am","_id":"94b728c06a6048b09541f4f8023a6de4","name":"Killzone 3","genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":1867,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"09/08/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-09-08T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"31043","price":6.35,"name":"Killzone 3","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Killzone 3","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"id":"sps3308","igdbId":1867,"gbId":30431,"gbGuid":"3030-30431","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}]},{"first_release_date":"02/18/2013","total_rating":75,"esrb":"M","videos":["lAOaKmuavsQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28p6.jpg","description":"The award-winning developer Crytek is back with Crysis 3, the first blockbuster shooter of 2013!

At the same time the shooting of Benno Ohnesorg is the beginning of the West German student movement. In the big world, there is a lot of turmoil, but most of the people are unaware of things happening in small, dreamy, german provincial cities: Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is surprised: he wins a trip to a small, german village: Trüberbrook. Truber-what? No Idea! And that he took part in a profit-play, he can´t really remember … But since he is quite well suited to get some distance from his dissertation in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, full filled of curiosity. \nTannhauser receives his lodging in the Pension Waldeslust, a charming hostel on the village square. But shortly after his arrival mysterious things happen: some documents disappear from his room, someone seems to have broken in. Somebody is also trying to get in touch with him – But who? \nGradually, he gets to know the villagers and spa guests, but one is stranger than the other.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.  HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.  HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.  An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.  Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.  Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-08-28","howAcquired":"Epic Games","notes":"free","createdAt":"08/28/2020 07:02 pm","updatedAt":"08/28/2020 07:02 pm","_id":"67ff680d1dc04842946b62587e9148b2","name":"HITMAN","genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"id":11157,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Tactical, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","purchaseDate":"08/28/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-08-28T05:00:00.000Z","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"08/19/2019","total_rating":77,"esrb":"M","videos":["lCCYJo8lfs8","wK6vDJ_nkz0","pcBei3JUz5s"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1m4w.jpg","description":"The world is in ruins.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner – a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done… by any means necessary.    The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.    With the Shadowrun Returns Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns with the Steam Workshop community. You can even explore the entire Shadowrun Returns Seattle campaign in the Editor directly – see how it was built and borrow as much as you need to jump-start your own creations! No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor.","story":"The player assumes the role of a shadowrunner who has fallen onto hard times since his or her last shadowrun in 2050. One of the player's teammates from that mission, Sam Watts, sends a pre-recorded video message to the player, where he reveals that he is likely dead, and that his final wish is that the player find whomever killed him. He also announces that he has 100,000 nuyen being held in escrow for the player should he bring whomever was responsible for his death to justice. Knowing that Sam resides in Seattle, the player travels to the city to begin their investigation. \nUpon arriving in Seattle and visiting the morgue where Sam's body is being examined, the player discovers that Sam is the latest victim of the Emerald City Ripper, a serial killer who has been surgically removing organs from his or her victims. The Runner soon enlists the help of one of Sam's friends to help find the killer; Jake Armitage, returning from the SNES Shadowrun game. Jake soon leaves the party as he is being hunted by multiple gangs and corporations over an unrelated shadowrun and must go into hiding, but he points the player to the scene of the crime, and to further leads that could help break the case open. Soon afterwards, the player meets Coyote, a female elf bartender/shadowrunner who is waging a private war against \"Better-Than-Life\" (\"BTL\") chips and those who trade them. She was a friend of Sam's as well; together they follow the Ripper as he commits more murders across Seattle. During their investigation they assist the more cooperative police officers assigned to the case, as well as the friends and family of the Ripper's victims (including Sam's sister, Jessica Watts), as they attempt to find and identify the Ripper. \nTheir pursuit eventually leads them to Mercy Mental Hospital, where they find that a male elf named Silas Forsberg has taken the identity of the original administrator. Silas has been using the facility as a front for his organ harvesting operation; not only in his role as the Ripper, but also for financial gain (both by selling organs from unrelated victims to street clinics, and by brainwashing particular inmates at the hospital and then selling them as sex slaves). After killing Silas, the player learns he was directed to commit the Ripper murders by another party. They quickly determine that Jessica Watts commissioned Silas to commit the crimes, based partially on an earlier admission that she had been estranged from her brother. Sam and Jessica had lived a comfortable life before their father's passing, and despite his best efforts early on to live a decent life, he cracked under the pressure and spent the family savings on drugs and alcohol. He eventually became a shadowrunner to make ends meet, and to further fuel his self-destructive habits. \nWhen the player confronts Jessica at Sam's funeral Jessica reveals she had indeed ordered her brother's death, and the deaths of the other Ripper victims so her mother could have a proper funeral. She subsequently snaps and orders her bodyguards to kill the player, Armitage (who has briefly come out of hiding to pay his respects) and Coyote. The bodyguards fail, but she and a mysterious elf woman escape. While going over the dead bodies, the party discovers that Jessica is a member of the Universal Brotherhood, which is well known as an international new age spiritualism organization that attracts rich and poor alike. They also discover that the elf at the funeral was Lynne Telestrian; not only is she a high-ranking Brotherhood member, but her family manages Telestrian Industries. Between the corporation and to a lesser extent the Brotherhood, and she and the rest of her kin are extremely wealthy and influential. Armitage, not wanting to get himself in further trouble with the powers that be, goes back into hiding after discovering this. \nThe player and Coyote track Jessica to the Brotherhood chapter near Pike's Market. While Coyote waits outside, the player cases the building and discovers that the Brotherhood are very heavily armed and have been involved in the disappearances of several individuals. Letting Coyote into the building via the service entrance, they break into the \"inner sanctum\" of the facility and discover that the Universal Brotherhood is itself a front for an insect spirit hive. The runners also meet Jessica again, who is says she is quite aware of the Brotherhood's true nature. The team rescues a young elf woman before escaping the facility, finding that they are unable to kill the these exotic spirits with their current weapons. \nThe woman however connects the team with her boyfriend, a decker named Baron Samedi. Under his directions, the team infiltrates Telestrian Industries, as they were working on Project Aegis; a chemical weapon capable of killing spirits easily. The operation is not successful, however, and the player is forced to infiltrate the company a second time alone in order to retrieve the only sample of the Aegis compound. The player acquires the sample but is captured while trying to escape. Given the importance and secrecy assigned to Aegis, the player is brought before the owner of the company, James Telestrian. \nHere the player learns the truth behind Sam Watts and his sister; that they were both half breed children of the Telestrian bloodline, the product an affair between James' father and Sam's mother. To prevent the truth of the affair from becoming public knowledge, the senior Telestrian paid Sam's mother handsomely and they \"officially\" became the offspring of James Watts, another employee at Telestrian Industries. This is important as the young woman who the player rescued from the Brotherhood is actually James' daughter. Jessica, who is also revealed to be the insect shaman of the hive, had become aware of the connection and was going to use the close familial connection help aid her in bridging over a Queen insect spirit into the real world. Also at the mansion is the immortal elf Harlequin, who discusses how insect spirits need to inhabit bodies of sapient life forms to exist in the material world, and also states that the existence of a Queen in the real world be disastrous. Volunteering to help destroy the hive, Harlequin joins the player and his team a the final raid on the Brotherhood chapter. Telestrian gives the player, and Harlequin, each a shotgun able to fire capsules filled with the Aegis compound. Before they leave, the player also discovers that Lynne Telestrian is as fully committed to the hive as Jessica, if not more so. Her loyalty to the Brotherhood led her to blow up the Telestrian Industries factory producing Aegis recently, not only estranging her from James but also leaving the sample and the prototype weapons the only articles remaining from the project. \nThe team infiltrates the hive and they fight their way into the heart of the inner sanctum. There they discover Jessica and Lynne Telestrian in a magical circle; since James' daughter was taken out of their reach and thus can no longer become the host for the Queen, Lynne has volunteered herself to be the host and they are in the process of completing the ritual. The team disrupts the summoning by seriously wounding Jessica and killing most of the insect spirits inside the hive, a feat made possible due to the Aegis weapons. The queen spirit abandons Jessica, and the player is given the option to kill her or arrest her. Lynne survives, but is arrested and eventually sent to a mental hospital. \nThe game concludes with Armitage, Coyote, Harlequin and James Telestrian discussing the fallout of the raid, with Harlequin musing that other Brotherhood chapters across the world also hold hives similar to the one in Seattle. Having satisfactorily solved the circumstances of Sam's death, the player attempts to collect the money he left. Sam's second message congratulating the player asks him to apologize to Jessica for what he put her through, and that he never actually had any money in escrow, and suggests the player ask the people he and his family knew for a reward of some kind, which the player does at a 1,5 million Nuyen payment, garnished after the assault on Telestrian industries to a mere 15,000 Nuyen payout. The player could also ask for the same money Sam promised, a position as Security VP (making them a company man for Telestrian), the resignation of a particular officer or preserving Touristville. \nIn the epilogue following Sam's last message, the game reveals that Aegis was eventually developed into a product called \"Fluorescing Astral Bacteria-3\", or \"FAB-3\". As per the history of the pen-and-paper game Shadowrun Returns is based on, the destruction of the Chicago Universal Brotherhood hive is botched and the city is largely sealed up behind a wall to keep the rampaging insect spirits inside the city. FAB-3 is used some time later to cleanse Chicago of its insect spirit infestation. \n \n- Credits: Wikipedia","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-08-28","howAcquired":"Epic Games","notes":"free","createdAt":"08/28/2020 07:05 pm","updatedAt":"08/28/2020 07:05 pm","_id":"2d77ae8eccb147a4b1ded5e00c98f068","name":"Shadowrun Returns","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Adventure","Indie"],"id":3020,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":true,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS), Adventure, Indie","purchaseDate":"08/28/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-08-28T05:00:00.000Z","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"09/17/2014","total_rating":84,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co26fv.jpg","description":"Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns.

The player controls an unnamed protagonist who is attempting to rescue his love interest, the Princess Mariko, from Akuma's castle fortress. The game exhibits a combination of a side-scrolling platform and fighting game elements. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress. The game, as with most at the time of development, lacked checkpoints or the ability to save the game, making it a challenge to complete in a single sitting.  Karateka has been well-received, particularly for its realistic animations used for the game's characters. The game was considered a breakthrough success for Mechner, and would eventually result in his development of the Prince of Persia franchise. A high-definition remake, spearheaded by Mechner, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, with planned ports for the iOS and Wii U systems.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-08-07","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"08/08/2020 08:05 am","updatedAt":"08/08/2020 08:05 am","_id":"7094ebd1865642b880a235882d07c04e","name":"Karateka","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Indie"],"id":4602,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Indie","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"08/07/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-08-07T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","id":"20163","price":7.28,"name":"Karateka","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1988","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1koa.jpg","description":"Baseball is an action game which can be played by two players or one player against the computer.

The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":8,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-08-01","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"08/01/2020 09:17 pm","updatedAt":"08/01/2020 09:17 pm","_id":"64f504f006f142379523d06bfbc96ef2","name":"Ice Hockey","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Hockey"],"id":18532,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"2","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Sport, Hockey","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"08/01/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-08-01T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"NES","id":"11995","price":4.01,"name":"Ice Hockey","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/30/1985","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E10+","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2k3z.jpg","description":"Several levels await your super-tough Commando in this arcade conversion.

Although the player controls Fox for almost the entirety of the game, the first level of Star Fox Adventures involves playing as another fox called Krystal, who speaks another language, from a different planet called Cerinia.  Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.  Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.  Fox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.  Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.  To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.  Fox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.  In order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.  Prince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick.  As you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu.  There are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time.  The game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi.  It is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games.  When engaged with an enemy, the combat is real time, meaning each of Fox's movements in combat require the press of the A button, similar to how each sword swing in Zelda or Skyrim require the press of a button.","story":"Fox Mccloud investigates a planet on the edge of the Lylat System called Dinosaur Planet, which is falling apart.

Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counter-attack, prompting the ISA evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions with more powerful weapons appear, the ISA find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. The player reassumes the role of Sev, a surviving member of the Special Forces unit Alpha Squad, who must fight against vindictive, merciless enemy forces in a desperate attempt to escape Helghan alive.","story":"The game begins in medias res from the point of view of two Helghast soldiers who have arrived at Stahl Arms Corporation, Jorhan Stahl's weapons factory. The two are taken to a room where the captured Jason Narville's execution is about to be broadcast by Stahl across Helghan. As the two soldiers are about to execute Narville, they reveal themselves as Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko and Rico Velasquez and the scene cuts back six months earlier, immediately following the events of Killzone 2. \nSev and Rico regroup with Captain Jason Narville outside Scolar Visari's palace and they begin their evacuation towards the remaining ISA ships on Helghan. They face heavy resistance from organised Helghan troops led by Admiral Orlock, whose battle plan is well received by most of the senate except for Jorhan Stahl, the chairman of Stahl Arms, the largest weapons manufacturer on Helghan. From the outset, the animosity between the two parties is made apparent. Rico receives a transmission from Jammer and separates from the group to rescue her squad who have encountered heavy resistance. Due to a poorly-engineered evacuation a few ISA ships are unable to depart, separating Rico from Sev and the rest of the ISA forces, and leaving all of them marooned on Helghan. \nJumping six months forward, the Helghast senate expresses their disappointment with Orlock's search for the remaining ISA forces, since he had initially promised that they would be dead within the hour. One of the senators suggests to relieve Orlock, and replace him with Stahl, but is refused. As a result Stahl refuses to deliver his weapon prototype and other resources (Stahl Arms itself) to the military as long as Orlock is on charge, citing the Admiral as incompetent. Stahl organizes his private army to hunt down the ISA who are hiding in a Helghast jungle. Narville dispatches Sev along with a soldier named Kowalski to retrieve a satellite uplink in order to contact the Vektan government. Upon doing so, Earth Command informs Sev and Narville that the ISA has agreed to a cease-fire and that they are to surrender so their release can be negotiated. The Helghast soon track the ISA in the jungle, ending with their capture and the death of Kowalski after a brutal battle. \nRico and his men, including Jammer, who have been separated from the main group for six months, are able to rescue Sev, who convinces them to save Narville and the rest of the captured ISA forces. They track them to Stahl's base and discover a horrifying new weapon using irradiated Petrusite, a compound that causes its victims to explode. Disguised as Narville's executioners, Sev and Rico rescue Narville in addition to freeing some of their men who were held as prisoners of war and used as test subjects for Stahl's new weapons. On their way out, Rico and Sev discover Stahl's plan to destroy Earth, the most powerful military force and the leading imperial force which colonized all the other worlds; their downfall would allow the Helghast to dominate and reclaim all the other colonies. \nEmbarrassed by Stahl's failure to execute Narville, the senate chooses to vote Orlock as Helghan's new Autarch and he orders Stahl to transfer his new weapons to the Helghast military. Stahl is made to confront Orlock at the space station where he plans to assassinate Stahl. After a grueling ground battle with the Helghast forces, remaining ISA soldiers arrive at the orbital elevator and use it to ride up to the space station. \nOn the station, Stahl turns on Orlock, destroying his fleet and murdering him after a brief duel, and makes preparations to bombard Earth. The remaining ISA forces hijack two fighters and Sev manages to shoot down Stahl's cruiser. Unwilling to let Stahl escape the cruiser, he drops a nuke on the falling cruiser, detonating the Petrusite weapons it was carrying above Helghan's atmosphere. The Petrusite engulfs the entire planet and wipes out almost everything on its surface. Jammer then reports that Helghan has gone dark, with not a single communication being heard. Sev contemplates on the many lives on the planet obliterated by the Petrusite. \nIn a mid-credits scene, two Helghast soldiers are searching through some ruins when they come across an escape pod. Though the occupant's identity is not revealed, both soldiers bow and say, \"Welcome home, sir,\" implying that Stahl survived and managed to escape his cruiser before it was destroyed.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":4,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-07-24","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"07/25/2020 07:41 am","updatedAt":"07/25/2020 07:41 am","_id":"6f620a723a8f4e7f86812b437ce9aafa","name":"Killzone 3","genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":1867,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"07/24/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-07-24T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"31043","price":6.35,"name":"Killzone 3","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Killzone 3","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"id":"sps3308","igdbId":1867,"gbId":30431,"gbGuid":"3030-30431","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}]},{"first_release_date":"03/12/1996","total_rating":81,"esrb":"T","videos":["li9mwWFoqlk","BlrNIOgJtA8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1omi.jpg","description":"You're going down... again.

The Worlds are populated by NPC's, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney's Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the \"Heartless\" forms the other.  Successful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes.  The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency \"Munny\", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated. Such items include those used to restore HP and MP, items to aid party members or synthesis materials which can be used to create weapons and armor.","story":"The universe of Kingdom Hearts is a collection of various levels, referred to as \"worlds\", through which the player must progress. Thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game. \n \nThe graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the world are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship. \n \nThe worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several Final Fantasy games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the Final Fantasy characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each \"Keyhole\"; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance. \n \nKingdom Hearts begins with Sora's Dive to the Heart, which foreshadows the events that will soon take place, but soon progresses to Destiny Islands, where Sora lives with his two best friends, Riku and Kairi. The three friends seek to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose. One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures. Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku first; Riku disappears into darkness, curious about what it contains. Soon after, Sora obtains a mysterious weapon, the Keyblade, to defend himself. Using it to fend off the creatures, he heads for a secret cave, where he finds Kairi near a door. She turns to him, saying his name as the door behind her blows open. The ensuing blast of darkness sends Sora and Kairi both out of the cave. The islands are soon destroyed, and Sora is left adrift, Riku and Kairi's whereabouts unknown.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation

All-new music, voice acting, choreography and added dialogue give way to a more expansive and immersive experience than ever before.","story":"The plot of Black Mesa is almost identical to Half-Life's storyline, playable through the \"Lambda Core\" chapter. As in the original game, the player controls Gordon Freeman, a scientist working at the Black Mesa Research Facility. He is tasked to place a sample of a strange material into an electromagnetic instrument, using the Hazardous Environment Suit Mark IV to do so safely. However, the sample material causes a \"resonance cascade\", devastating the facility and creating an interdimensional rift to an alien dimension called Xen, bringing its alien creatures to Earth. \n \nFreeman survives, finds other survivors, and makes his way to the surface with the protection of his hazard suit to get help. Upon reaching the surface, however, he finds that the facility is being cleansed of any living thing - human or alien - by armed forces. From other scientists, Freeman finds the only way to stop the alien invasion is to cross over to Xen and destroy the entity holding the portal open.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":13,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-28","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"Steam summer sale","createdAt":"06/28/2020 07:56 am","updatedAt":"06/28/2020 07:56 am","_id":"7ec0ffc3c8084b41bb86793fa8a9c5a6","name":"Black Mesa","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Adventure","Indie","FPS"],"id":6739,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Adventure, Indie, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"06/23/2010","total_rating":57,"esrb":"M","videos":["C4URFHKeKvU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e42.jpg","description":"The game is a tactical shooter played from a first-person perspective. As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit.  The main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character.  Most of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game.  The single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.","story":"In the game, players take the role of various characters for different missions. Among them are a sniper, Sergeant Tyler \"Razor Six-Four\" Wells, for long range missions and stealth assignments, a Delta Force operator, Private Cole Anderson, as well as a rebel, El Tejon, for missions involving direct firefights. The main plot centers around a highly trained special ops unit that is sent into the fictional country of Isla Trueno, whose democratic government has been overthrown by a hostile force. \n \nUndercover CIA Agent Mike Rodriguez infiltrates the entourage of General Vasquez in order to set up a shot for the sniper-spotter team Alpha Nine. Killing the general would put an end to the regime on Isla Trueno. During the assassination attempt, Agent Rodriguez is compromised and captured, and General Vasquez escapes. After a series of missions, the assault team Delta Three, supported by sniper unit Razor Six Four, manages to free Agent Rodriguez from an enemy camp. \n \nWith Vasquez on the loose, Delta Three and Razor Six-Four are sent to set up an air strike on a cocaine plantation. After the successful destruction of the plantation, the evacuation chopper comes under attack and has to leave. Razor Six Four makes his way through enemy territory in order to reach the new evacuation point from where he is extracted. \n \nAgent Rodriguez teams up with Sergeant Tyler Wells to steal plans of a nuclear warhead from an enemy camp. The mission is a success, but Agent Rodriguez turns out to be a traitor. He takes the data and leaves Sergeant Wells to be shot by the enemy. A rebel leader called El Tejon rescues Sergeant Wells, who then tracks down Rodriguez, kills him and retrieves the data. \n \nBecause the data files are incomplete, the Alpha Nine sniper-spotter team steals the rest of the data from the enemy. Together with Razor Six Four, Alpha Nine then eliminates Ernesto Salazar, General Vasquez' advisor. Decryption of the stolen data uncovers the location of a secret uranium mine on Isla Trueno. Delta Three and Razor Six-Four enter the mine facilities in an enemy truck, free the civilian workers and destroy the compound. To fully dissolve the now weakened regime, a second attempt is made to kill General Vasquez. Razor Six-Four completes the assignment successfully, and the game ends the moment Vasquez is struck by the bullet.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":3.33,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-27","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"bought in bundle with all 3 Sniper: Ghost Warrior games for 9.99","createdAt":"06/28/2020 07:52 am","updatedAt":"06/28/2020 07:52 am","_id":"60a42e580aca44d48f1363071345a31f","name":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior","genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Tactical","FPS"],"id":1367,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Simulator, Tactical, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"04/24/2017","total_rating":62,"esrb":"M","videos":["JtIpEAQgLvM","NKmi3Yu6IKc","z33Mjdg7BBY","xDAK9_XU0Tg","2lmntSa7qTk","5pO8H4qidxA","CX-rJUXpn2E","TQWdjV5833U","_seqcrC3S4k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rgp.jpg","description":"Go behind enemy lines with the ultimate modern military shooter.

The game's story is set a year after the original. Geese Howard, a rising star in South Town's criminal underworld, calls fighters to the city for a new tournament, \"The King of Fighters.\" Howard was the final boss and series villain of SNK's other fighting game franchise Fatal Fury (though he is a secret boss in this game), whose story took place over a decade after the events of Art of Fighting. Art of Fighting 2 was the only time Yuri Sakazaki was a playable character in the series. It also marked the only time that she donned her trademark outfit, which was made famous in The King of Fighters series. This game also marks the debut of Takuma Sakazaki without his Mr. Karate persona, as well as Eiji Kisaragi, who both appear in the King of Fighters series. Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance. This game is also notorious for its difficulty, with it being referred in many fighting circles as having some of the toughest opponent AI in a fighting game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-13","howAcquired":"Twitch","notes":"","createdAt":"06/13/2020 07:41 am","updatedAt":"06/13/2020 07:41 am","_id":"ebd22dbe27154553ba76d8545f3db517","name":"Art of Fighting 2","genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"id":6556,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":true,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Arcade","purchaseDate":"06/13/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-06-13T05:00:00.000Z","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"videos":null,"description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-13","howAcquired":"Twitch","notes":"","createdAt":"06/13/2020 07:43 am","updatedAt":"06/13/2020 07:43 am","_id":"22293cec1dbd4a93befe6d7ee909a7b0","name":"Blazing Star","genres":["Shooter","SHMUP","Arcade"],"id":86005,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":true,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, SHMUP, Arcade","purchaseDate":"06/13/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-06-13T05:00:00.000Z","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"image":"https://hb.imgix.net/65a41f2586a708874cb079f741a041184f679ed1.jpg?auto=compress,format&fit=crop&h=353&w=616&s=5daf89b94b5f5af607413c096d22a999","caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"01/15/1993","total_rating":71,"esrb":"","videos":["AlZ1q2Gddsc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1t2q.jpg","description":"The GRANDMOTHER of all battles! 15 of the FATAL FURY series' top stars gather in the match of the millenium!

The game has very obvious similarities in design and gameplay to R-Type. It is actually believed that some ex-Irem employees left the company to join Aicom, which used to be a subcontractor for various coin-op manufacturers like Jaleco or SNK.  Despite the familiarities, Pulstar is not without innovations. There is the option of using the weapon power bar, which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is depressed. When fully charged the ship delivers a devastating emission of energy. The left-hand side turns red when it is continually pressed, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.  The in-game visuals are mostly pre-rendered 3D graphics, which gives the interactive elements a far more realistic appearance. Great care was taken to really place the player into the world of the game, with cinematic style cut scenes and pre-rendered movies.  There is a hefty reliance on strategy and not just blasting everything in sight. Using the charged weapon is key, and requires careful precision. Also, once a power up is obtained, a small orb appears at the posterior end of the ship. This can be used as an advantage by deflecting/absorbing oncoming enemy fire and taking out small enemies that run into it.","story":"In the year 2248, the first recorded sign of extraterrestrial life was discovered coming from Mars. The signal emanated from the planet and from it an object travelled through space at light speed out of the Solar System. Earth scientists read the signal, but not knowing the nature of it, warned the world's defenses in case aliens traced the signal and followed it to Earth with the intent to destroy. \n \nEight years later, aliens followed the signal to the Solar System and began attacking the human space craft awaiting them along Neptune’s orbit. The battle between the humans and aliens spread throughout the Solar System; within two years of combat Neptune was disintegrated, Jupiter was turned into a star and more than half of Earth's continents sank from rising ocean levels and the planet's changing axis as a result. Kaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino246, is one of the few survivors left of the Pulstar attack force founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders; it is through her that mankind may have a chance to survive the alien menace.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-13","howAcquired":"Twitch","notes":"","createdAt":"06/13/2020 07:44 am","updatedAt":"06/13/2020 07:44 am","_id":"22b5339388b74283b5e80d89a528a722","name":"Pulstar","genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"id":7255,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":true,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade, SHMUP","purchaseDate":"06/13/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-06-13T05:00:00.000Z","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"01/01/1994","total_rating":81,"esrb":"E","videos":["VUxPwSlWWrc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vu42fhc3yo5xtda11bsh.jpg","description":"One of SNK's legendary fighting game series has made a return!

Catch-a-ride on the lunar landscape with new vehicles equipped with deadly weapons allowing for more levels of destructive mayhem. So grab a friend (or two, or three), strap on a rocket, and take off on a brand new Borderlands adventure","story":"The opening of The Pre-Sequel begins some time after the events of Borderlands 2, and immediately after Episode 3 of the subsequent game Tales from the Borderlands, on the flying city of Sanctuary, where the three former Vault Hunters Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai interrogate the ex-Atlas assassin Athena after having captured her. Athena recounts her story, starting after the death of General Knoxx, when she received an offer to go find a Vault on Pandora's moon, Elpis, from a Hyperion programmer named Jack. She joins fellow Vault Hunters Claptrap, Nisha, Wilhelm, Timothy, and Aurelia on a spaceship headed for the Hyperion moon base Helios. On the way, they are ambushed by the Lost Legion, an army of former Dahl marines led by Colonel Tungsteena Zarpedon, and crash-land onto the moon base. After meeting up with Jack, they attempt to use Helios' defense system against the Lost Legion, but realizes there is a jamming signal coming from Elpis. They attempt to escape, but they are stopped by Zarpedon and a mysterious alien warrior, so Jack stays behind to fend them off and sends the Vault Hunters to Elpis via a moonshot rocket. \n \nAfter landing on Elpis, the Vault Hunters are helped by Janey Springs, a junk dealer who guides them to the spaceport town Concordia. Here, the Hunters, under Jack's orders, request help from his ex-girlfriend Moxxi to find the jamming signal. After raiding a former Dahl station, they find out that the signal was put up by the Meriff, the person in charge of Concordia, as well as Jack's former Hyperion underling. While this is happening, Zarpedon activates Helios' primary weapon, the Eye of Helios, which fires a powerful beam on the surface of Elpis, stating she plans to destroy the moon to stop Jack from opening the Vault. Jack confronts and kills the Meriff at his office. With Concordia secured, Jack and Moxxi guide the Vault Hunters to the next step in retaking Helios. They infiltrate a Lost Legion base, run by two Dahl officers, the Bosun and the Skipper, in search of a military artificial intelligence, which Jack plans to use to build a robot army. After defeating the Bosun, it is revealed that the Skipper, who renames herself Felicity, is the A.I. they were looking for. The Vault Hunters travel to a robot production facility, where Jack enlists the help of another Hyperion scientist named Gladstone to build his robot army. Gladstone suggests using his prototype robot, named the Constructor, which has the ability to build an infinite number of robots. At first, Felicity agrees to help them by becoming the A.I. for the Constructor, but upon witnessing the violence she has to go through, she begins to hesitate. After being forced into the Constructor bot, she takes control of it and battles the Vault Hunters. Felicity is defeated, and her personality is deleted from the Constructor bot. \n \nHaving obtained his robot army, Jack and the Vault Hunters travel to Helios, while enlisting the aid of Moxxi and two former Vault Hunters, Roland and Lilith (who were on Elpis for a vacation). While on Helios, Jack ruthlessly kills Gladstone and the other scientists working for him after suspecting one of them to be a spy for the Lost Legion. The Vault Hunters defeat Zarpedon and her forces, and proceed to reboot the Eye of Helios. It is revealed that the Eye is actually the eye of the Destroyer, the monster that was released from Pandora's Vault in the first game, in which Jack took and made into a weapon. The Vault Hunters inject slag(Eridium runoff made by Hyperion) into the Eye, under Moxxi's directions. When attempting to reboot, Moxxi, Roland and Lilith betray Jack and destroy the Eye to prevent him from gaining ultimate power. Seeking revenge, Jack and the Vault Hunters travel back to Elpis, where they find its Vault having already been opened, as mentioned by Zarpedon before her death. The Hunters battle several of the Vault's guardians, and defeat its ultimate guardian, the Deva-like Empyrean Sentinel. \n \nWith the Sentinel dead, Jack enters the Vault, but finds no item of value, other than a mysterious symbol floating in midair. As he interacts with it, the symbol shows Jack a vision of the Warrior. However, he is interrupted by Lilith, who phasewalks in front of him and punches through the Vault symbol, burning it onto Jack's face and disfiguring him. She teleports away, leaving a scarred and insane Jack behind, who swears vengeance on Lilith and all the \"bandits\" on Pandora, now intent on awakening the Warrior to take over the planet. Realizing that the hero who once saved her on Helios is no more, Athena leaves Jack's employ. \n \nHaving finished listening to Athena's story, Lilith orders the Crimson Raiders to execute her, against Brick and Mordecai's protests. However, as they open fire on her, Athena is saved by the alien warrior who appeared on Helios with Zarpedon, revealed to be one of the legendary Eridians. The Eridian warns the Vault Hunters of an imminent war, and that they will need \"all the Vault Hunters they can get\". \n \nDuring the credits, several scenes are shown revealing what became of the Vault Hunters after helping Jack. Wilhelm and Nisha join Jack in his rise to power; Wilhelm is transformed further into a machine and destroys the settlement of New Haven while Nisha is made Lynchwood's sheriff and hooks up with Jack, who proceeds to raise an army, Athena discards the money given to her by Jack and leaves Elpis, and Claptrap is dismantled and left for dead by Jack at Windshear Waste. In a post-credit scene, Jack, now going by the name Handsome Jack and wearing a synthetic mask to hide his facial scarring, kills his CEO, Harold Tassiter, and announces to Tassiter's secretary on an intercom that he has replaced him as the new head of Hyperion.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-06-06","howAcquired":"Epic Games","notes":"","createdAt":"06/08/2020 06:51 am","updatedAt":"06/08/2020 06:51 am","_id":"b76029b719974ead85a6547d76547bf9","name":"Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","FPS"],"id":6032,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"08/01/2016","total_rating":82,"esrb":"E","videos":["mRjsohqwz9Q"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co262g.jpg","description":"Overcooked! is a co-op cooking game for 1-4 players.

Featuring intense first-person action, vehicle combat, an expansive world and jaw-dropping graphics powered by id’s revolutionary idTech 5 technology. RAGE promises an experience like no other.","story":"On August 23, 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis collides with Earth, destroying human civilization and turning the world into a wasteland. Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde. \n \nIn 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind. \n \nRaine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead. \n \nIn Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants. \n \nWith the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":5,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-05-23","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"05/23/2020 07:17 am","updatedAt":"05/23/2020 07:17 am","_id":"efb2b65546c449f98fc16c99cec2d37a","name":"Rage","genres":["Shooter","Racing","FPS"],"id":509,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Racing, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"02/24/2016","total_rating":77,"esrb":"RP","videos":["BfABNZqU-PA","fc17r931tN0","mZXyxZK28QY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20u3.jpg","description":"Enter an apocalyptic fantasy world where humanity is on the brink of extinction, iron is valued above gold and trust is hard earned.

This forsaken continent is home to many writhing horrors, murderous beasts, and ravenous undead. The very soil is permeated with dark, ancient power, the earth shivering with malice. The dead are refused peace, rising up and hopelessly wandering in eternal pain, sorrow and hunger. The wildlife is twisted and misshapen, unnaturally aggressive and savage. Lurking in the darkest of corners, unspeakable horrors lie in wait for unsuspecting prey, eager to rip apart the mind as well as the flesh. Wraeclast is a place where few remain alive, and fewer remain sane.","story":"All exiles are given the same choice: to sink or swim. Those that don't drown will reach the forsaken shores of Wraeclast, where the only welcome is the clinging embrace of undeath. However, a small band of survivors has managed to hold fast in a ruined lighthouse, desperately repelling both the grasping undead and the manic scavengers that stubbornly cling to their last shreds of humanity. Under the commanding gaze of Axiom Prison, snarling goatmen roam the craggy bluffs, always keeping their cloven feet well clear of the rhoa-infested swamps in the lowlands. All along the coast, rotting shipwrecks litter the shoreline, the spirits of the stranded sailors still haunting the wreckages of their ill-fated ships, waiting to take out their sorrow and rage on those who yet live. All the while, the Siren herself continues her sweet, sad song, luring ever more ships to their watery graves. \n \nFarther inland, through the twisting caves and darkened forests, the ruins of civilisation become more apparent. The ravages of time have worn many buildings to rubble, and stripped away decaying flesh, leaving only grotesquely grinning bones. The dark, fetid caves and underground passages are a clattering refuge for these skeletal ranks, while the open forests and riverways brim with monstrous beasts with a taste for blood. Recently, ragtag groups of bloodthirsty bandits have built fortified camps in the forest, openly challenging one another while extorting food and supplies from the small, struggling village that sits between them atop a stone dam. Ignored by the squabbling bandits, strange newcomers clad in black armor have been seen skulking around various large ruins, their purpose both mysterious yet unsettling. \n \nAtop a sheer cliff of ruptured mantle, straddling the river feeding a mighty waterfall, lies the fallen capital of the Eternal Empire. Its former glory rots amid the ruins of a blasted cityscape, the buildings decrepit and mouldering. But Sarn is far from uninhabited. Many of the original citizens still lurk the dark recesses, their humanity washed clean by the cataclysm of centuries past. These Undying monsters roam the city at night and skulk the shadows during the day, for the naked sunlight is anathema to their shrivelled, leathery skin. The sun-scarred days are far from peaceful, however. A legion of soldiers from Oriath has occupied the area to the west of the river, and is fighting an all-out war against the multifarious denizens of the city. Every day their black-clad soldiers battle twisted insects that scuttle and breed, feasting on anything that moves. Every day they throw battalions against the army of floating, red Ribbons that eviscerate all who trespass on their domain. Every day they skirmish against a small group of exiles who have barricaded themselves on a small island in the middle of the river, caught between certain death on both sides.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-05-16","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"free to play","createdAt":"05/23/2020 07:08 am","updatedAt":"05/23/2020 07:08 am","_id":"e344099777e744b8a8391dd4c8dbb55e","name":"Path of Exile","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Indie"],"id":1911,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure, Indie","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"05/13/2010","total_rating":82,"esrb":"T","videos":["qSGPU3FnD8Q"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dft.jpg","description":"Presented in the style of a TV series, Alan Wake features the trademark Remedy storytelling and pulse-pounding action sequences.

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name.  Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer.  A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-05-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","updatedAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","_id":"7bfda36d16354cf6943e1c53cc0d3b23","name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":47321,"name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"id":"mxb1529","gbId":17491,"gbGuid":"3030-17491","tgdbId":8037,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}},{"value":"Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false},{"igdbId":47321,"name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360"],"id":"xbox452","gbId":17491,"gbGuid":"3030-17491","tgdbId":8037,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":47321,"manual":true,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"05/07/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-05-07T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox","id":"6529","price":4.39,"name":"Rainbow Six 3 Black Arrow","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/09/2009","total_rating":50,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hx6l8rgjb8cmxkrfonyg.jpg","description":"Discover a thrilling I SPY adventure hidden in a mysterious old house!

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","story":"The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location. \n \nThe chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story. \n \nIn 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-04-16","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","updatedAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","_id":"5a12b44cc1f34e58bf28237fda8fc1ad","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc29","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"id":"ngc22","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Adventure","Horror"],"id":3907,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Adventure, Horror","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"04/16/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-04-16T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Gamecube","id":"3270","price":92.69,"name":"Eternal Darkness","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/16/2017","total_rating":80,"videos":["LO1LSG4UBe4","Cbh6fGMaBMI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1krz.jpg","description":"Relive the golden age of arcade sports gaming with Super Blood Hockey — A violent homage to classic 8-bit and 16-bit ice hockey games.

The brothers are moved individually by two thumbsticks on the controller. The controller triggers also cause the respective brother to interact with the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object.  The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).  Should either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.","story":"A man, clinging to life.

After a decade of war with the Lunar invaders we named the Selenites, the British Empire finally vanquished the insect-like menace thanks to a dashing officer by the name of Hugo Wells.

Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes.

The father, an astronaut, is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \"senses\" the Prince's work—she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky. Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Nintendo Switch","consoleId":130,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":11,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-03-29","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","notes":"bought 4 games from him for $45 so just splitting the cost between the 4","createdAt":"03/29/2020 07:16 pm","updatedAt":"03/29/2020 07:16 pm","_id":"40d60898bcc84ad5a87f3b5bc9c20577","name":"Katamari Damacy REROLL","genres":["Puzzle"],"id":109458,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"switch","purchaseDate":"03/29/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-03-29T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Nintendo Switch","id":"53845","price":13.49,"name":"Katamari Damacy Reroll","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"12/01/2008","total_rating":51,"esrb":"E","videos":["BscGJ22dog8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dee.jpg","description":"Prince of Persia: The Fallen King is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Casablanca.[1] The game was released for the Nintendo DS in December 2008, as a spin-off of Prince of Persia.

The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.  This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.  Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.  The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.  The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":11,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-03-29","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","notes":"bought 4 games from him for $45 so just splitting the cost between the 4","createdAt":"03/29/2020 07:19 pm","updatedAt":"03/29/2020 07:19 pm","_id":"1d1c309f471e4b90971ba19a7b3d88f5","name":"Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"id":5844,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"03/29/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-03-29T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5260","price":10.65,"name":"Gauntlet Seven Sorrows","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/29/2013","total_rating":81,"esrb":"M","videos":["InnWpcxWj-k","I7zHkJMMvVM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1vpp.jpg","description":"The year is 2007.

A unique feature of this instalment is two scrolling shoot-'em-up levels, the first of which Mario pilots a submarine, and the second an aeroplane.","story":"Once upon a time, there was a peaceful world called Sarasaland.

By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.","story":"Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17. After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. \nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. \nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. \nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. \nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":6,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-03-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/16/2020 06:27 am","updatedAt":"03/16/2020 06:27 am","_id":"c90ca2e5712b49f1a78a043875d1383e","name":"Half-Life 2","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - This game does not play on PAL-60 televisions with composite cabling this does not affect PAL-50, Screen corruption in attract mode after console has been idle for a long period of time"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":233,"name":"Half-Life 2","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - This game does not play on PAL-60 televisions with composite cabling this does not affect PAL-50, Screen corruption in attract mode after console has been idle for a long period of time"],"id":"mxb1195","gbId":1539,"gbGuid":"3030-1539","tgdbId":146,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - This game does not play on PAL-60 televisions with composite cabling this does not affect PAL-50, Screen corruption in attract mode after console has been idle for a long period of time","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false},{"igdbId":233,"name":"Half-Life 2","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - This game does not play on PAL-60 televisions with composite cabling this does not affect PAL-50, Screen corruption in attract mode after console has been idle for a long period of time"],"id":"xbox175","gbId":1539,"gbGuid":"3030-1539","tgdbId":146,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - This game does not play on PAL-60 televisions with composite cabling this does not affect PAL-50, Screen corruption in attract mode after console has been idle for a long period of time","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":233,"manual":true,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"03/15/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-03-15T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox","id":"6287","price":10.29,"name":"Half-Life 2","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1992","total_rating":47,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ie1eybk5gpzadocmwtxy.jpg","description":"The Ren & Stimpy Show: Space Cadet Adventures is an Action game, developed by Imagineering Inc and published by THQ, which was released in 1992.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":0,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-03-06","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/07/2020 06:55 am","updatedAt":"03/07/2020 06:55 am","_id":"abcd3cd5392143e4a6c66fecc50e9637","name":"The Ren & Stimpy Show: Space Cadet Adventures","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"id":48971,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ds","purchaseDate":"03/06/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-03-06T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"GameBoy","id":"13609","price":8.43,"name":"Ren & Stimpy Space Cadet Adventures","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/01/1991","total_rating":76,"esrb":"RP","videos":["sLpS_s1PaXM","MXjaCkPWpvU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zm2.jpg","description":"Streets of Rage is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game developed and published by Sega in 1991 for Mega Drive/Genesis.

However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train. \nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time.

Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.","player_perspectives":["First person","Side view","Text"],"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-03-06","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/07/2020 06:56 am","updatedAt":"03/07/2020 06:56 am","_id":"5c2cb4807515406faf6c31ef29715dcf","name":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"id":1426,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Point-and-click, Puzzle, Adventure, Visual Novel","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ds","purchaseDate":"03/06/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-03-06T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","id":"4114","price":21.17,"name":"Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"05/18/1989","videos":["Yb9ZF7YaYzY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kyihq0rylzxbkotzxp9p.jpg","description":"Baseball Stars has become one of the most influential games in the development of sports video games since it was first released in 1989 by SNK. it was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as the PlayChoice 10 Upright Arcade Cabinet, and became a huge success throughout the world.

Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst?  The stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective.  The stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore.

Sneak into old ruins, haunted cathedrals and mansions of the rich. Incapacitate your enemies quietly or in an open fight. This unique sneak-em-up game provides you with a range of means to achieve your goal. Remember though - secrecy is your best friend.  Thief Gold is a first-person perspective stealth game. It was the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics – different surfaces cause varying noise (for example carpets are quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud). You can use sound to your advantage - it’s not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, Thief Gold can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay.  This extended edition includes all of the missions from the first release, as well as three new missions adapted to the original storyline, with full voice acting and new graphics.

The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in February 2011. It is the fifth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise and the first to use three-dimensional character models instead of sprites.  In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play designed to make the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.  The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and character roster, while criticizing its online component and lack of features and game modes. More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success. Less than a year after its release, Capcom announced an updated version of the game, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The standalone update was released in November 2011, and featured additional characters, stages, and gameplay tweaks.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":12,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-02-29","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/01/2020 07:59 am","updatedAt":"03/01/2020 07:59 am","_id":"afb9eab7856e4b8e8b4bf7c665f15f92","name":"Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting"],"id":8248,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"02/29/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-02-29T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"30985","price":9.99,"name":"Marvel Vs.

The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The objective of the game is to destroy both, asteroids and saucers. The triangular ship can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-02-22","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"02/22/2020 06:44 pm","updatedAt":"02/22/2020 06:44 pm","_id":"116eff1b6e2d48d5830ed906c8258b80","name":"Asteroids","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"id":7758,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade, SHMUP","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"02/22/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-02-22T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","id":"15110","price":3.5,"name":"Asteroids","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1980","total_rating":71,"videos":["vrXcInJojhY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1khz.jpg","description":"Maneuver your humanoid through the electrified mazes of robot filled rooms.

In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess but also become the new king.  As a young Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with an eccentric cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess.  As is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never die in the game or reach a point in the game where a puzzle cannot be solved. The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of Monty Python (the game starring former Monty Python actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans.  While the video game leaves open the possibility for a sequel, no sequel for the game was planned.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Saturn","consoleId":32,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":6,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-02-14","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"02/15/2020 06:29 am","updatedAt":"02/15/2020 06:29 am","_id":"1642a755d4c74094b472d01f1d185d63","name":"Blazing Dragons","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"id":45514,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"02/14/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-02-14T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Saturn","id":"8618","price":20.69,"name":"Blazing Dragons","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"07/04/1996","total_rating":75,"esrb":"","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mvw.jpg","description":"Slip off into the dream world and go on an aerial adventure as NiGHTS in this classic Saturn remake.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured. Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":11,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-02-08","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"02/08/2020 04:04 pm","updatedAt":"02/08/2020 04:04 pm","_id":"b6f0a4213b92456d81e02712e4720d7f","name":"Galaga","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"id":2751,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade, SHMUP","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"02/08/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-02-08T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"NES","id":"11991","price":14.52,"name":"Galaga: Demons of Death","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"01/20/2009","total_rating":84,"esrb":"","videos":["4Juh0p6u5rM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wkwd1ga1qr9xrudotbsw.jpg","description":"It's been five long years since your mysterious disappearance from the skate scene, and much has changed in the wake of \"the disaster-too-gnarly-to-be-named.\" The massive devastation left large swaths of San Vanelona completely destroyed.

Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.The controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.Final Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.","story":"Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters—former pro wrestler and newly elected mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter's boyfriend Cody, and Cody's best friend Guy—as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":"2","splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","consoleName":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)","consoleId":19,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":15,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2020-01-31","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 06:45 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 06:45 am","_id":"483a35be8d164b7692c1bf8fe04650cb","name":"Final Fight","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"id":1655,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bitbox","purchaseDate":"01/31/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-01-31T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Super Nintendo","id":"6928","price":15.28,"name":"Final Fight","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"06/28/1998","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w21.jpg","description":"Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far.

A large purse of prize money which was to be awarded to the fighter who could defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round provided incentive for warriors from all over the globe. \n \nFinanced and sponsored by the giant financial groups, the Mishima Zaibatsu, the first Tekken tournament began with eight fighters, all of whom had emerged victorious in death matches held all over the world, all motivated by different motives, all possessing the skill and power to crumble mountains. \n \nMany battles were fought. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the title of King of the Iron Fist. \n \nThis warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's cold blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five. \n \nAfter a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the skills which had been passed down from generation to generation of the Mishima clan. \n \nAs Heihachi's broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knees and slowly lifted his father into his arms. Walked slowly to the edge of the same cliff where his father had left him to die, stared out over the landscape of all that was now his, and let go of his father's body. As Heihachi's body plummeted, Kazuya's smile gleamed in the sunlight... \n \nOne year has passed. The Mishima Zaibatsu under Kazuya's leadership has become even more powerful with its tendrils reaching to all corners of the world. Soon after his father's apparent death, Kazuya disappears into the shadows. However, rumors of his immense power, and a dark side, slowly begin to spread throughout the world. \n \nExactly two years after the first Tekken tournament, a message is relayed from the Mishima Zaibatsu fortress to news agencies all over the world announcing a second tournament with a prize a thousand times that of the first. \n \nSo the tournament begins...","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":10,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-01-25","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"01/25/2020 03:23 pm","updatedAt":"01/25/2020 03:23 pm","_id":"69f9f7b365da483c89a41715be55e600","name":"Tekken 2","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Tekken 2","details":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"id":"psx535","igdbId":1243,"gbId":10387,"gbGuid":"3030-10387","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony PlayStation","id":"ccl20","igdbId":7,"gbId":22,"gbGuid":"3045-22","tgdbId":10}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting"],"id":1243,"manual":true,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"-1","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"cd","purchaseDate":"01/25/2020","newDatePurchased":"2020-01-25T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation","id":"4810","price":19.16,"name":"Tekken 2","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/06/2017","total_rating":76,"esrb":"M","videos":["6Dfq2B4LcNs","z3ezu8QJEtY","gWVjuObLuSw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20r8.jpg","description":"\"Battle your way through throngs of Stygia’s mutated inhabitants, performing masterful kills throughout the single-player campaign—or one of 30 competitive score-challenge or 12 co-operative multiplayer maps—using Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition’s unique “Skillshot” system that rewards you for executing the most creative and deadly kills imaginable.

Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Rough","case":"custom","pricePaid":2,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-12-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"12/29/2019 05:39 am","updatedAt":"12/29/2019 05:39 am","_id":"2ebd9a9a98ac420cb9e3b433faac4ae7","name":"Pac-Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"id":2750,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Strategy, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"12/28/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-12-28T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","id":"15378","price":7,"name":"Pac-Man","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/13/2014","total_rating":75,"esrb":"T","videos":["ZOq4IiuRMWk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p96.jpg","description":"A Legendary Pairing: Cut down entire legions of enemies as Link, Zelda, Midna and other characters from The Legend of Zelda franchise using over-the-top powerful Dynasty Warriors-style moves.

Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players.

Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.

The bowler (on the left side of the screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before releasing the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the pins. Knocking down every pin on the first shot is a strike, while knocking every pin down in both shots is a spare. The player's score is determined by the number of pins knocked down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":1,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/30/2019 08:01 am","updatedAt":"11/30/2019 08:01 am","_id":"8b043398ce9241b394f9f27c3d943d39","name":"Bowling","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Bowling"],"id":18005,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Sport, Bowling","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"11/28/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-28T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","id":"15134","price":4.76,"name":"Bowling","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/31/1979","total_rating":73,"esrb":"E","videos":["ndjFSmI4EN8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pk3.jpg","description":"Defender is an arcade video game developed released by Williams Electronics in 1980. A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.  Defender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":1,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/30/2019 08:02 am","updatedAt":"11/30/2019 08:02 am","_id":"d67858950b954ba59bdffdbc2a3e2404","name":"Defender","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Strategy","SHMUP"],"id":3873,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Strategy, SHMUP","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"11/28/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-28T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","id":"15196","price":4.99,"name":"Defender","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1977","total_rating":69,"videos":["GuCXiz45i9k","uk7fIrXpW8o"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pxutukwqpci8mfusrjcx.jpg","description":"Combat is an early video game by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":7,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/30/2019 07:56 am","updatedAt":"11/30/2019 07:56 am","_id":"567f2901f54b4d4a8291ad6426bfb3f6","name":"Super Baseball 2020","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Baseball"],"id":46193,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"2","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Sport, Baseball","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"sega","purchaseDate":"11/28/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-28T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Genesis","id":"16184","price":20.55,"name":"Super Baseball 2020","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1993","total_rating":82,"esrb":"RP","videos":["ANgGDW2h8uU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/enp7iuwrcv3besmuelnv.jpg","description":"In the game you are a male or female protagonist (Zeke or Julia), fighting the vampires, mummies, zombies, etc. on over 50 levels (not including secrets) and saving all of the people you find.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.  Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.  The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.  At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).  When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"original release without \"Not for resale\"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","_id":"d0a1f25adb5443fa8ea0eeab5c953b1d","name":"Sonic the Hedgehog","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd217","name":"Sonic The Hedgehog","igdbId":3192,"gbId":2465,"gbGuid":"3030-2465","tgdbId":40416,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":3192,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"sega","purchaseDate":"11/15/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-15T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Genesis","id":"9789","price":31.29,"name":"Sonic the Hedgehog","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/09/1999","esrb":"E","videos":["Em6efpysWOU","5yXpkhpyaic"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27td.jpg","description":"NBA 2K (also known as NBA2K or Sega Sports: NBA 2000) is the first installment of the NBA 2K series.

Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.","story":"The opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters as they ride a train on Pandora. However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. \nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. \nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. \nJack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. \nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. \nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen fades to black.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":2,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:16 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:16 pm","_id":"1b6a239369f541b5b7c7175ed0b0e1b0","name":"Borderlands 2","extraData":["Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also available in Borderlands: The Handsome Collection which includes remastered versions of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox One"],"extraDataFull":[{"details":["Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also available in Borderlands: The Handsome Collection which includes remastered versions of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox One"],"name":"Borderlands 2","igdbId":1011,"id":"x36091","gbId":36055,"gbGuid":"3030-36055","tgdbId":5647,"special":[{"value":"Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also available in Borderlands: The Handsome Collection which includes remastered versions of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox One","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","FPS"],"id":1011,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"11/15/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-15T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"33057","price":5.43,"name":"Borderlands 2","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/12/2009","total_rating":77,"esrb":"M","videos":["apbgshuBe6M"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27c8.jpg","description":"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom.

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.  L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.  The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.  The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","story":"Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high.

It is a reimagining of the first installment in the series, MediEvil, with many alterations to the original structure and content, such as the addition of the \"Anubis Stone\" sub-plot which never appeared in the original. Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.","story":"In 1286, an evil wizard named Zarok sought to take over the Kingdom of Gallowmere. Legends tell of a brave knight named Sir Daniel Fortesque who slayed the evil wizard and brought peace to Gallowmere. In actuality, however, Dan was the first to die in the Battle of Gallowmere, struck down by an arrow in the eye during the first charge. A century later, in 1386, Zarok returns and casts a spell over Gallowmere, robbing the souls of its people and raising the dead. This spell also resurrects Dan, who is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie who was robbed of his powers by Zarok and cursed to reside in Dan's skull. Seeing his resurrection as a chance to prove himself a true hero, Dan goes on a quest to seek revenge against Zarok, collecting pieces of an artifact called the Anubis Stone along the way. After collecting all the pieces and making his way to Zarok's lair, Dan is confronted by Zarok and his immortal army, but Dan manages to stop this army by using the Anubis Stone to summon the souls of those who fought in the Battle of Gallowmere. Zarok transforms into a cobra and a last-ditch attempt, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok perishes, he sets his lair to self-destruct in the hopes of taking Dan down with him, but Dan is saved by Al-Zalam, who had been freed from his curse upon Zarok's demise. As peace returns to Gallowmere, Dan returns to his eternal rest, where he finally earns his place as a true hero in the Hall of Heroes.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-11-09","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","updatedAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","_id":"cd6aa89da33b42df85ab85efcf52b32b","name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp170","igdbId":4005,"gbId":14258,"gbGuid":"3030-14258","tgdbId":7099,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp151","igdbId":4005,"gbId":14258,"gbGuid":"3030-14258","tgdbId":7099,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":4005,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"psp","purchaseDate":"11/09/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-09T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"PSP","id":"9313","price":10.74,"name":"MediEvil Resurrection","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"07/16/2011","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["0AdrvpM8L4Q"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wwu.jpg","description":"The Star Fox team triumphantly returns to one of its greatest missions with this remake of Star Fox 64 in full 3D, featuring a complete graphical update.

He also meets Rusty Slater, his former racing rival, who also works for Castaldi. Tanner later learns that Castaldi is working with a man named Don Hancock, who is running for president. He later suspects that Slater has been spying on him and wrecks Slater's car during a road chase, resulting in Slater being arrested. \n \nThe Castaldi family move to Los Angeles, where Castaldi plans to assassinate FBI agent Bill Maddox as part of Castaldi's plan to carry out a more high-profile assassination in New York. Tanner tells Leck, a police associate, to ensure Maddox turns up, otherwise Tanner's cover may be affected. The assassination on Maddox is successful, but the police ambush the gangsters, forcing Tanner to take them to safety. Tanner convinces the suspicious gangsters that Slater likely told the police about the planned assassination while under interrogation. Leck later tells Tanner that McKenzie recently met Marcus Vaughn, a corrupt FBI agent who is working with Castaldi and Hancock. \n \nThe Castaldi family then move to New York, the location of the planned high-profile assassination. Tanner is told by his police associates that McKenzie wants him to pull out of the undercover operation, as he is worried that Tanner's cover will not hold up much longer, and Leck tells Tanner that Hancock has bribed several members of the FBI. Tanner remains undercover and continues working for Castaldi, intent on discovering what he is planning. \n \nTanner eventually learns that Castaldi plans to assassinate the President of the United States, and Tanner is tasked with driving the President's car. However, he ignores all instructions and takes the President to safety. McKenzie then arrives and tells Tanner that Castaldi and all of his associates, including Hancock and Vaughn, have been arrested. He then tells Tanner to take his badge back, but Tanner refuses, suspecting that the police and FBI are involved in the job, corrupted by bribes due to Vaughn's involvement. Tanner leaves, ignoring McKenzie completely.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-11-06","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"11/10/2019 06:39 am","updatedAt":"11/10/2019 06:39 am","_id":"013bba790c434a909821d07897668cf2","name":"Driver","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Driver","details":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"id":"psx160","igdbId":675,"gbId":7020,"gbGuid":"3030-7020","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony PlayStation","id":"ccl20","igdbId":7,"gbId":22,"gbGuid":"3045-22","tgdbId":10}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Racing","Simulator"],"id":675,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Racing, Simulator","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"cd","purchaseDate":"11/06/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-11-06T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation","id":"4395","price":6.04,"name":"Driver","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/28/1999","esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qxt.jpg","description":"The classic videogame PONG is getting a 32-bit update.

After his resurrection by the Terror Mask, Rick makes his way through the mansion, fighting off hordes of creatures in a vain attempt to save his girlfriend Jennifer from a grisly fate. Players of this game will also recognize a number of western horror film influences, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead 2.  Similar to many sidescrolling beat 'em up games, Rick can only move in a two-dimensional environment. The playing field does not feature a three-dimensional area, a feature that was added later in the series with Splatterhouse 3. He has the ability to jump and can punch and kick. Rick also has a Special Attack, where he will perform a drop kick that sends him skidding along the ground, damaging any enemies he hits. Rick can also perform a low kick, low punch, and jumping attacks, as well as pick up and use various weapons placed in the levels.  All of the levels consist of walking left to right, with occasional auto-scrolling segments. However, alternative pathways through sections of the house are possible by falling down through holes or jumping up onto ladders. In this way, branching gameplay is possible, if only prevalent in the middle levels. Levels culminate in boss fights that take place in a single room. Unlike traditional side-scrolling fighters, boss fights have varying objectives and styles. Unlike most arcade games in the genre, Splatterhouse sends players back to checkpoints after losing lives or reaching game over, discouraging \"credit feeding\" as a method of overcoming the various challenges.","story":"Two college students, Rick Taylor and Jennifer Willis, take refuge from a storm in West Mansion, a local landmark known as \"Splatterhouse\" for the rumors of hideous experiments purportedly conducted there by Dr. West, a renowned and missing parapsychologist. As they enter the mansion and the door shuts behind them, Jennifer screams. \n \nRick awakens in the dungeon of the mansion to discover that he is still alive thanks to the influence of the \"Terror Mask\", or in some versions, the \"Hell Mask\", a Mayan sacrificial artifact from West's house which is capable of sentient thought. The mask attaches itself to Rick, fusing with his body and transforming him into a monster with superhuman strength. With the mask's encouragement, Rick goes on a rampage through the dungeon and the mansion grounds, killing hordes of monsters. Inside the mansion, Rick finds Jennifer, prone on a couch and surrounded by a throng of creatures that retreat upon his arrival. After their departure, Jennifer transforms into a giant, fanged monster that attempts to kill Rick while begging him for help. Rick is forced to kill Jennifer, who transforms back to normal and thanks him before she dies. Infuriated, Rick tracks the remaining monsters to a giant, bloody hole in the mansion's floor. Upon entering it, Rick discovers that the mansion itself is alive. He follows a bloody hallway to the house's \"womb\", which produces fetus-like monsters that attack him. Rick destroys the womb, which causes the house to burst into flames as it \"dies\". \n \nEscaping the burning mansion, Rick comes across a grave marker. The Terror Mask releases energy into the grave, reviving a giant monster named \"Hell Chaos\" that claws its way up from the earth and attempts to kill Rick. Rick destroys the creature, which unleashes a tormented ghost that dissipates into a series of bright lights. As the lights vanish, the mask shatters, turning Rick back to normal, and he flees as the house burns to the ground and the credits roll. However, after he leaves and the credits end, the Terror Mask reassembles itself and laughs evilly, staying there for 45 seconds, with the word \"END\" appearing on the bottom right corner of the screen.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":70,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-09-13","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/13/2019 08:58 pm","updatedAt":"09/13/2019 08:58 pm","_id":"3823f79da35646e1a4d7f506aa6ebfb3","name":"Splatterhouse","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"id":6929,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"09/13/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-09-13T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16","id":"12082","price":72.52,"name":"Splatterhouse","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/13/1988","total_rating":66,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/x0qmeswjdz3qlr6kholc.jpg","description":"Imagine a living pinball machine...with aliens and outlandish worlds to throw at you.

You move a crosshair around the screen and shoot targets. Occasionally, you can also choose to change directions at fixed points.  Of course the real attraction in a game like this is the story. In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels. Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as \"ratigators.\" You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators. It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.","story":"Sewer Shark takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where environmental destruction has forced most of humanity to live underground. The player takes on the role of a rookie pilot in a band of \"sewer jockeys\", whose job is to exterminate dangerous mutated creatures to keep a vast network of sewers clean for \"Solar City\", an island paradise from which the evil Commissioner Stenchler (Robert Costanzo) gives his orders and critiques. The player's copilot, Ghost (David Underwood), evaluates the player's performance throughout the game, while a small robot named Catfish (voiced by Robert Weaver) scouts ahead and gives directions. The player is later assisted by Falco (Kari G. Peyton), a female jockey who believes that there is a hidden route to the surface. Falco is later captured by Stenchler, who threatens to mutate her into one of his mindless minions. This plot is thwarted when Ghost and the player reach Solar City.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Sega CD","consoleId":78,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-09-01","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/02/2019 06:34 am","updatedAt":"09/02/2019 06:34 am","_id":"ca04250f5ab2437bb7536888b01ab6bf","name":"Sewer Shark","extraData":["Sega CD launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Sewer Shark","id":"scd37","details":["Sega CD launch title"],"igdbId":4293,"gbId":7427,"gbGuid":"3030-7427","tgdbId":739,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega CD","id":"ccl15","igdbId":78,"gbId":29,"gbGuid":"3045-29","tgdbId":21}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":4293,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"09/01/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-09-01T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega CD","id":"13719","price":8.37,"name":"Sewer Shark","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/29/2016","total_rating":99,"esrb":"M","videos":["YmLeUJgzsXY","5wmNeg5WVck","qy8jmm9kY4A"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wz4.jpg","description":"Become a professional monster slayer and embark on an adventure of epic proportions!

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. \n \nGeralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad. \n \nArriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages. \n \nAfter sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship. \n \nThe pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir. \n \nCiri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. \n \nThe ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org, only main game]","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":16,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-09-01","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"02/22/2020 05:52 am","updatedAt":"02/22/2020 05:52 am","_id":"b8af43e6694d4d3da808654e301a8a05","name":"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year Edition","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":22439,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"first_release_date":"11/15/2006","total_rating":77,"esrb":"T","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25w1.jpg","description":"Celebrating 20 years of vampire hunting action, the legendary Castlevania series is back with an all-new action packed adventure.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.  By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.  Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer","consoleId":50,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":19,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-08-31","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"09/02/2019 06:33 am","updatedAt":"09/02/2019 06:33 am","_id":"877ff149b84943e1b455d5793d640b9d","name":"Road Rash","genres":["Fighting","Racing"],"id":3249,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Racing","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"08/31/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-08-31T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"3DO","id":"16611","price":37.01,"name":"Road Rash","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"05/25/1995","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1h4w.jpg","description":"Super Columns is charged with new ways to play and win at this intensely gripping puzzle game.

A freak whirlpool of air and water tore the life from Ecco’s home leaving Ecco all alone. Now he must fight to stay alive, while traversing the vast ocean in search of clues that will help him save his family and return them to the bay.","story":"The game opens with Ecco, a bottlenose dolphin, as he and his pod are swimming in their home bay. A podmate challenges Ecco to a game to see how high he can jump into the air. When he is in the air, a giant waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay, Ecco swims around meeting other marine life including other dolphins who tell them they have felt the storm and the entire ocean is in chaos. An orca Ecco encounters tells him to travel to the Arctic to meet the \"Big Blue,\" an old blue whale revered by marine life for its age and wisdom, who might be able to help him on his journey. Arriving in the Arctic after a long travel through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue who informs the dolphin the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn't know what causes the storms, he suggests Ecco find the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. The Asterite greets Ecco telling him though it has the power to aid him, the Asterite cannot because orbs from its body have been lost. The Asterite tells him to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, and use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans. \n \nEcco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals stored with information. From the library Ecco learns the origins of the storms, an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet, so every 500 years when the planets align, they use their technology to harvest the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex that ended when a beam struck Atlantis from space sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated she spits out Ecco's pod she ate and they make their quick escape back to Earth.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega CD","consoleId":78,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":9,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-08-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"08/16/2019 06:53 am","updatedAt":"08/16/2019 06:53 am","_id":"1db4818710ec4a1faef09e04b4ec86b0","name":"Ecco the Dolphin","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure"],"id":5378,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"08/15/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-08-15T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega CD","id":"13834","price":19.41,"name":"Ecco the Dolphin","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"02/14/2007","total_rating":85,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wtd.jpg","description":"In the curious village of St. Mystere, townsfolk speak to each other in riddles, lock their doors with sliding puzzles and hide their secrets within brainteasers.

It was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. Toshiaki Mori provided promotional artwork during the release of the game, including cover art.Deadly Silence includes a \"Classic Mode\", the original game with minimal enhancements and touch-screen support, and a \"Rebirth Mode\", containing a greater number of enemies and a series of new puzzles that make use of the platform's specifications.The game makes use of the dual screen display with the top screen used to display the map, along with the player's remaining ammunition and health (determined by the color of the background); while the bottom screen displays the main action, and can be switched to show the player's inventory. The DS version also includes updated play mechanics: the 180-degree turn introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, along with the knife button and tactical reload from Resident Evil 4. The updated controls are applicable to both Classic and Rebirth modes. Dialog and loading screens can now be skipped. The live-action footage was still censored, even in the game's Japanese release; however, the scene showing Kenneth's decapitated head was kept.In \"Rebirth\", new puzzles are added that use the system's touch-screen. \"Knife Battle\" sequences, viewed from a first-person perspective, are also added, in which the player must fend off incoming enemies by swinging the knife via the stylus. One particular puzzle requires the player to resuscitate an injured comrade by blowing into the built-in microphone. The player can also shake off enemies by using the touch screen, performing a melee attack.The game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes. The first is a cooperative mode in which each player must help each other solve puzzles and escape the mansion together.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. When part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. Occasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-07-25","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"07/28/2019 08:37 am","updatedAt":"07/28/2019 08:37 am","_id":"fd7dd4f4c6c04a67b2aba54ed2cc9656","name":"Lumines","extraData":["Sony PSP launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"spsp157","name":"Lumines","details":["Sony PSP launch title"],"igdbId":4689,"gbId":5057,"gbGuid":"3030-5057","tgdbId":7095,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]},{"id":"spsp141","name":"Lumines","details":["Sony PSP launch title"],"igdbId":4689,"gbId":5057,"gbGuid":"3030-5057","tgdbId":7095,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Puzzle"],"id":4689,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"psp","purchaseDate":"07/25/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-07-25T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"PSP","id":"9258","price":4.59,"name":"Lumines","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"06/28/1998","total_rating":82,"esrb":"E","videos":["NjYWVia5bAM","3wiv-mQPl5M"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zsj.jpg","description":"In this 3D platformer, the heroic but naive bear Banjo enlists his cowardly bird buddy Kazooie to help rescue his younger sister from a vain, beauty-stealing witch.

The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers – mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks – Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one. Some Hordes roam the highways at night, while others, like the one in the demo, have found a food source that keeps it in a single location. Skills learned in his prior life as an outlaw biker have given Deacon a slight edge in the seemingly never-ending fight to stay alive.

Featuring intense first-person action, vehicle combat, an expansive world and jaw-dropping graphics powered by id’s revolutionary idTech 5 technology. RAGE promises an experience like no other.","story":"On August 23, 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis collides with Earth, destroying human civilization and turning the world into a wasteland. Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde. \n \nIn 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind. \n \nRaine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead. \n \nIn Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants. \n \nWith the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":2.5,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-06-08","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"06/09/2019 09:03 am","updatedAt":"06/09/2019 09:03 am","_id":"dc57fb34819346e9947f4741720d38ab","name":"Rage","extraData":["Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One"],"extraDataFull":[{"details":["Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One"],"name":"Rage","igdbId":509,"id":"x360548","gbId":20672,"gbGuid":"3030-20672","tgdbId":895,"special":[{"value":"Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","Racing","FPS"],"id":509,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Racing, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"06/08/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-06-08T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"31795","price":6.01,"name":"Rage","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"08/12/2013","total_rating":75,"esrb":"M","videos":["O90W_yKFqsc","AsEigjyLKHo","4uaPImEg13s","f8ZMDfO88Xs","Hmp1da7pXTw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20u7.jpg","description":"Payday 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington D.C. for an epic crime spree.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":2.5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-06-08","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"06/09/2019 09:04 am","updatedAt":"06/09/2019 09:04 am","_id":"4b24e8bcc7194b49926acd4936dd1f39","name":"Payday 2","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","Tactical","FPS"],"id":2058,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), Tactical, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"06/08/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-06-08T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"34165","price":5.05,"name":"Payday 2","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/17/2011","total_rating":66,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["D_7W4-9Rfsc","ZTlRiC0PRLk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co230s.jpg","description":"We find our heroes in the midst of a dilemma of intergalactic proportions when Dr. Nefarious' latest evil plan goes awry leaving Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Nefarious himself caught in the snare of a powerful and mysterious machine.

The adventure takes place deep in the deserts of Egypt, where an ancient Temple to Set has just been discovered. Set, the god of chaos, once ruled all of Egypt after murdering his brother Osiris and enslaving the other gods, but when Egypt was no longer enough, he vanished into the land of the dead intent on raising an army that could conquer the world, but he never returned.  Lara Croft, famed explorer, thought she would be first to arrive at the temple, but up-and-coming archeologist Carter Bell beat her to the entrance. They each hoped to find the mythical Staff of Osiris, but they discovered more than they bargained for.  The Temple was a prison for Horus and Isis, the last of the old gods not bound to Set. Seeing the Staff, Carter removed it from a mechanism, setting off the trap meant to keep Horus and Isis imprisoned. Lara and Carter now find themselves marked for death. Horus and Isis, freed from thousands of years in prison and in possession of the staff, promise Carter and Lara they will help them resurrect Osiris, the only god capable of saving Lara and Carter from judgment, and the only power that can hope to defeat Set. With a common goal of finding the fragments of Osiris, and stopping the return of Set, the companions form an alliance.  As they fight their way across the sands, they must face gods and monsters of myth and legend driven mad and controlled by Set. At stake is the fate of the world, as Set marshals his powers in order to return and reclaim his throne in the world of the living, with an army of the dead behind him. Set knows the prophecy has come, intent on remaking the world in his own image, a nightmare of storms and death.

The game marked Pierce Brosnan's fourth appearance as James Bond before the release of his fourth and final Bond film Die Another Day. His likeness was featured in the game, but not his voice, which was provided by Maxwell Caulfield. Overall there are many weapons that the player can carry including grenades of various sorts and other types of explosives. In addition, there are numerous amounts of mounted weapons found throughout the game. As with previous James Bond games, the weapons that appear are based on actual weapons, but with the names changed. Some weapons appear in the console version but not the PC version, and vice-versa.","story":"The game's prologue mission starts in Paris, France, with James Bond helping French Intelligence operative Dominique Paradis evade a gang chase while chasing a truck with a stolen nuclear weapon, before continuing in his car. After stopping the truck from blowing up the Eiffel Tower, Dominique and James celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\nThe British Government sends Bond undercover to a party in industrialist Raphael Drake's Austrian castle. M believes that the party is a cover for the exchange of a missile guidance chip between Raphael Drake and Alexander Mayhew, who manages the Japanese branch of Drake's industry, Phoenix International, and had stolen the chip from the United States. Phoenix is believed to be a front for weapon smuggling. M gives Bond the instruction for 007 to rendezvous with CIA agent Zoe Nightshade and Dominique, who is posing as Drake's mistress. While Zoe distracts the guards, Bond makes his way to the exchange and steals the chip. Agents Nightshade and 007 make an try to make an escape on a cable car, when Drake's bodyguard, Rook, attacks the cable car with a rocket-launching helicopter. Bond shoots down the attacking helicopter using rockets found in the cable car. James and Zoe then escape Drake's forces in an armored snowmobile before continuing in James' car. They rendezvous with Q, who takes them out of Austria.\n\nAfter the breach, Drake threatens to kill Mayhew, should the operation fail. Mayhew contacts MI6, saying he will provide vital information if Bond comes to his rescue. At his Japanese estate, Mayhew is attacked by Drake's men, consisting of Japanese thugs. Bond fights his way through the estate and manages to obtain a file from Mayhew's safe. As they are prepared to make an escape from the estate, Mayhew is killed by a ninja. The file leads Bond to Mayhew's office at the Phoenix Building in Tokyo.\n\nBond is able to infiltrate the building while the guards are changing shifts and secures official NightFire documents. He is then attacked by Drake's men before Dominique provides a distraction, which allows Bond to escape via parachute off the roof of the building.\n\nThe NightFire documents lead Bond to a nuclear power plant being decommissioned by Phoenix International. Bond retrieves evidence of Drake's activities and escapes. However, he is then double crossed and captured by Kiko, Mayhew's former bodyguard, and turned over to Drake. On the top of the Phoenix building, Drake plans to kill Bond and Dominique, who has been discovered as a mole. Dominique is kicked off the rooftop and killed by Kiko. Bond escapes to the ground level before being saved by Australian Intelligence agent Alura McCall.\n\nM sends Bond and Alura to Drake's private island, where Drake has set up a jamming signal. The pair infiltrate the island and eliminate Drake's defenses. M makes Bond aware of the UN, EU, and NATO forces arriving on the island to dismantle remaining enemy combatants. Bond makes his way to Drake's underground silo, fighting off Kiko before entering one of three space shuttles intending to capture the Space Defense Platform. Kiko incinerates in the blast pit when Bond's space shuttle launches. Bond reaches the U.S. Space Defense Platform, where Drake is. He successfully sends all eight missiles off course, saving millions of lives, and causes Drake's laser weapon to malfunction, leading to a huge explosion. Finally, Bond kills Drake. As the station goes up in flames, Bond blasts from an escape pod and goes back down to Earth, where M informs him that astronomers from around the globe are reporting \"unexpected meteor showers\" (which is actually the debris of the now-destroyed Space Defense Platform).","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":7,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-05-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"05/18/2019 03:35 pm","updatedAt":"05/18/2019 03:35 pm","_id":"06ed2453373540daa7bdcc75c12d6e9b","name":"James Bond 007: Nightfire","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"James Bond 007: Nightfire","details":["Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"id":"mxb1224","igdbId":1631,"gbId":6647,"gbGuid":"3030-6647","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}},{"value":"Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":1631,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"05/18/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-05-18T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox","id":"6489","price":6.37,"name":"007 Nightfire","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/31/2005","total_rating":64,"esrb":"T","videos":["pFHkZ47DLEo"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e6g.jpg","description":"From Russia with Love is a video game featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond.

The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":6,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-05-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"05/18/2019 03:34 pm","updatedAt":"05/18/2019 03:34 pm","_id":"1e4f1a8a82e04ec18b3744eb08356305","name":"007: Agent Under Fire","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire","details":["Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)"],"id":"mxb1222","igdbId":1643,"gbId":16559,"gbGuid":"3030-16559","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Microsoft Xbox Best of Platinum Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}},{"value":"Microsoft Xbox Classics (PAL)","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure","FPS"],"id":1643,"manual":true,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"05/18/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-05-18T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox","id":"6050","price":7.59,"name":"007 Agent Under Fire","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"01/30/1997","total_rating":88,"esrb":"T","videos":["oRanxri0sYs","bVIi735vvgo","jNQfY3G35y0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2evn.jpg","description":"Set in a dystopian world, Final Fantasy VII's story centers on mercenary Cloud Strife who joins with several others to stop the megacorporation Shinra, which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, the situation escalates and Cloud and his allies face Sephiroth, the game's main antagonist.","story":"The game begins with Cloud Strife, working as a mercenary for hire, helping the eco terrorist group AVALANCHE in a raid against the Mako reactors surrounding the Shinra-governed city of Midgar. Barret, the group's leader, believes the Mako energy the reactors consume to be the planet's lifeblood, and Shinra's reactors are killing the planet. Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa, is also in the group. Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is ambushed at the next reactor during a subsequent raid. When the reactor explodes, Cloud drops down into Midgar's slums. He is found by Aerith (aka Aeris), a girl he briefly met selling flowers after his first mission with AVALANCHE. Prompted by the arrival of the Turks, who have been sent to capture Aerith, Cloud agrees to act as her bodyguard and defends her from their assault. Meanwhile, Shinra learns the location of AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7, and subsequently destroys it by dropping the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums, killing its population. The Turks also capture Aerith, who is revealed to be the last surviving \"Cetra\", an ancient near-dead tribe closely attuned with the planet. President Shinra and Professor Hojo believe Aerith is the key to finding the \"Promised Land\", a mythical land of fertility they see as an abundant source of Mako. The remaining AVALANCHE members - Cloud, Barret and Tifa - infiltrate Shinra to rescue Aerith, in the process encountering a specimen simply labeled \"Jenova\". Joined by Red XIII, a sentient tiger-like creature on whom Hojo had been conducting experiments, the party rescues Aerith, but is captured by the Turks while trying to escape and detained within the building. In the morning, they find their cells open and most of the personnel, including President Shinra, killed: the perpetrator appears to be Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER leader who was presumed dead several years ago.The group discovers that the Jenova specimen is also missing, presumed stolen by Sephiroth. \n \nWhile the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, the party leaves Midgar and pursues Sephiroth across the planet. They are joined by Cait Sith, a cat-robot secretly controlled by repentant Turk Reeve Tuesti; Yuffie Kisaragi, a teenage ninja from Wutai; Vincent Valentine, a former Turk; and Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking pilot. At a Cetra temple, the party encounters Sephiroth, who reveals his plan: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream, made of pure Mako energy, will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use the legendary Black Materia to cast a spell called \"Meteor\" to cause a massive injury, enabling him to merge with the planet's Mako energy and be reborn as a god. The party drives off Sephiroth, acquiring the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the Materia. While the party recovers from the encounter, Aerith sets off to stop Sephiroth on her own, following him to an ancient Cetra city. The party follows, and finds Aerith praying to the planet for aid. Just as they reach her, Sephiroth kills her. Cloud and his allies track Sephiroth to the North Crater. During their journey, they find out that Jenova is an interstellar creature who crashed on the planet roughly two thousand years ago, intent on taking over completely. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called Weapons. While most humans fled, the Cetra managed to defeat Jenova and entomb its remains. A few decades before the present, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by Professor Gast, a researcher for Shinra. Mistaking Jenova for a Cetra, Gast attempted to clone Jenova, assisted by Hojo. Even though Gast abandoned the project, Hojo successfully managed to use his assistant's unborn child for the experiment: the baby was Sephiroth. Approximately five years before the present day, while on a Shinra mission with Cloud to Cloud's and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, Sephiroth encountered Hojo's failed test subjects and learned of his origins. Mistakenly believing that Jenova and he were Cetra, he was driven insane and destroyed Nibelheim as an act of vengeance on the normal human population. Cloud and Tifa confronted Sephiroth during the massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished, presumed dead until his reappearance in the present day. \n \nWhen the party reaches the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth for killing Aerith, they learn that Sephiroth was one of multiple Jenova clones that Hojo had created from both animals and humans. Upon reaching Sephiroth, who has been killing and absorbing the Jenova clones to instigate a \"Reunion\" of Jenova's cells, he manipulates Cloud into helping him cast Meteor, then states that Cloud is one of Sephiroth's clones, showing him memories of the Nibelheim incident with a black-haired SOLDIER in Cloud's place. The summoning of Meteor activates the planet's Weapons, and during the subsequent earthquake, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream. The rest of the party and the Turks that had followed them to the Crater escape on the airship, the Highwind, where the party members are placed under arrest. As Meteor approaches the planet, the Weapons turn on humanity in an attempt to return as much Mako energy to the Lifestream as possible to aid the planet. Shinra focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the Weapons and attempting to destroy Meteor directly, which eventually costs the lives of the majority of Shinra's personnel.[31] Tifa, Barret and the others are sentenced to be executed, but escape. They find a catatonic Cloud at a hospital in a tropical resort, where he washed up following the events at the North Crater. Tifa stays behind to help Cloud recover, while the rest of the party continue their fight against Shinra. An attack by the Weapons destroys the island, and Cloud and Tifa both fall into the Lifestream. There, Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories and learns the truth about his past. \n \nIt is revealed that Cloud was not accepted into SOLDIER, and that the SOLDIER in Sephiroth's visions was Aerith's first love and Cloud's friend, Zack Fair. The two were present during the Nibelheim incident, with Cloud managing to fatally wound Sephiroth, who only survived through Jenova's cells: Zack and Cloud were severely wounded and later taken and used by Hojo to perfect his SOLDIER and Jenova experiments. Zack tried escaping with Cloud but was killed by Shinra soldiers. Cloud recovered, took Zack's sword and made his way to Midgar: Cloud's own aspirations to SOLDIER and Zack's memories and stories combined, with the help of the Jenova treatment, to create a false personality. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud is able to recover. After Cloud and Tifa emerge from the Lifestream, the party regroup and learn that Aerith, in her final moments, was attempting to use the White Materia to cast the spell \"Holy\", the only means of opposing Meteor. It turns out she was successful in casting the spell, but Sephiroth has been preventing its release. The group decide to first stop the rampage of the Weapons. Alongside this, the party confront Hojo, revealed to be Sephiroth's father, as the scientist attempts to aid his son by feeding Mako energy to him. After mutating himself with Jenova cells, he is killed in combat. After this, they launch their final assault on Sephiroth, who is defeated by Cloud after a series of battles. The party escapes from the crater as Holy is released. Holy attempts to block Meteor under Midgar, but Meteor has drawn too close for Holy to combat it alone. Just before Meteor's impact, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":35,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-05-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"05/18/2019 03:29 pm","updatedAt":"05/18/2019 03:29 pm","_id":"154e749a921a45579c1086c3d8c5dbec","name":"Final Fantasy VII","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Final Fantasy VII","details":["Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits"],"id":"psx192","igdbId":427,"gbId":13053,"gbGuid":"3030-13053","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony PlayStation","id":"ccl20","igdbId":7,"gbId":22,"gbGuid":"3045-22","tgdbId":10}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":427,"manual":true,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"cd","purchaseDate":"05/18/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-05-18T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation","id":"4442","price":39.23,"name":"Final Fantasy VII","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/20/1997","total_rating":78,"esrb":"M","videos":["02kMHWKaMg8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g6l.jpg","description":"Drive dozens of varied vehicles around three of America's toughest cities.

Nintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening. Link's newest challenge is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide. As a castaway, Link must find a way to escape from the island and return to his beloved homeland of Hyrule.  But it won't be as easy as chartering a boat. The island's inhabitants have no knowledge of the outside world. One creature, a talking Owl, may know the solution to Link's dilemma, but first Link must tackle eight dungeons full of treacherous monsters and tricky taps. His goal: find the eight Instruments of the Sirens and awaken the omnipotent Wind Fish which rules the island.  Link will battle new enemies and make new friends in one of the most in-depth fantasy adventures for Game Boy yet!  A battery-backed memory will save up to three games so you never have to start your journey empty-handed.","story":"After the events of A Link to the Past, the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats. A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint Island where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would leave and travel across the sea. After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens. \n \nLink proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish. After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld. \n \nAfter collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish. This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past.[24] Its final transformation is \"DethI\", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow. After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream. When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear. Link finds himself lying on his ship's driftwood in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-05-03","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"05/05/2019 07:31 pm","updatedAt":"05/05/2019 07:31 pm","_id":"e481fcd0ad244b68b028fadc1869b4e3","name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","extraData":["Nintendo Game Boy Player's Choice"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","details":["Nintendo Game Boy Player's Choice"],"id":"ngb140","igdbId":1028,"gbId":3645,"gbGuid":"3030-3645","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Nintendo Game Boy Player's Choice","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo Game Boy","id":"ccl8","igdbId":33,"gbId":3,"gbGuid":"3045-3","tgdbId":4}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Adventure"],"id":1028,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ds","purchaseDate":"05/03/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-05-03T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"GameBoy","id":"16123","price":32.5,"name":"Zelda Link's Awakening","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/30/2010","total_rating":80,"videos":["47DKoSDeOUQ","wsGVYFBxY88","98mSNK2UKqg","X0w1iPWyoRA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dpt7jn81ttoczicvhxjp.jpg","description":"Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is a game in the Monster Hunter franchise for the PlayStation Portable system that was released in Japan on December 1, 2010.

Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE's new \"Living Battlefields\".","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Saturn","consoleId":32,"condition":"Fair","case":"original","pricePaid":14,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-04-20","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"04/20/2019 04:55 pm","updatedAt":"04/20/2019 04:55 pm","_id":"85e86314e1c8428db251313c6d90b879","name":"Soviet Strike","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Simulator","Strategy","Adventure"],"id":19418,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Simulator, Strategy, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"longbox","purchaseDate":"04/20/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-04-20T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Saturn","id":"9799","price":26.21,"name":"Soviet Strike","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1999","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":["GOFtNGF0w7s"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dah.jpg","description":"Tekken Tag Tournament is an update of Tekken 3 and is the fourth installment in the popular Tekken fighting game series.

The ages of the characters in this game are the same as the ages that they had in the last game that they were in. \n \nBecause Tekken Tag Tournament is a non-canonical game, it has no story. It is more of a compilation of Tekken, Tekken 2, and Tekken 3, allowing players to use almost every character in the Tekken series. The only characters that did not return from previous games are the first King, Marshall Law, the first Jack robot, the first Kuma, Gon, and Doctor Boskonovitch (although Dr. Boskonovitch does make a cameo appearance in Tekken Bowl). \n \nTekken Tag Tournament also introduced two new characters, Tetsujin and Unknown. Tetsujin is a \"pallette swap\" for Mokujin. Unknown is the final boss of Tekken Tag Tournament. Both of these new characters are \"mimic\" characters. Tetsujin never returned to any game in the Tekken series, but Unknown returned - once again, non-canonical - Tekken Tag Tournament 2.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":6,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-04-20","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"04/20/2019 04:57 pm","updatedAt":"04/20/2019 04:57 pm","_id":"0f8d8e6132e3426bb6e40b3231539f23","name":"Tekken Tag Tournament","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Tekken Tag Tournament","id":"ps2641","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"igdbId":1249,"gbId":10162,"gbGuid":"3030-10162","tgdbId":3770,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isExclusive":false},{"name":"Tekken Tag Tournament","id":"ps2417","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title"],"igdbId":1249,"gbId":10162,"gbGuid":"3030-10162","tgdbId":3770,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Sport","Strategy"],"id":1249,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"-1","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Real Time Strategy (RTS), Sport, Strategy","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"04/20/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-04-20T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5880","price":8.62,"name":"Tekken Tag Tournament","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/25/2000","total_rating":81,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p1h.jpg","description":"2000 SameGame release with custom skin support","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-04-20","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"04/20/2019 04:57 pm","updatedAt":"04/20/2019 04:57 pm","_id":"356a0ac44a584803a44e996237e2783e","name":"SSX","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title","Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"SSX","id":"ps2529","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title","Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"igdbId":4175,"gbId":1932,"gbGuid":"3030-1932","tgdbId":5424,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}]},{"name":"SSX","id":"ps2345","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 launch title","Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"igdbId":4175,"gbId":1932,"gbGuid":"3030-1932","tgdbId":5424,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"special":[]}],"genres":["Puzzle","Racing","Simulator","Sport","Snowboarding"],"id":4175,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Racing, Simulator, Sport, Snowboarding","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"04/20/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-04-20T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5818","price":7.19,"name":"SSX","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/03/2004","total_rating":87,"esrb":"E","videos":["cSIDghMWVMA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1uja.jpg","description":"When the sorcerer Vaati turns Princess Zelda to stone, the king of Hyrule sends Link on a quest to free Zelda from her curse.

The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.  • Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he’s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.  • When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.  • Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.  • As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.","story":"The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure.

Eight years have passed since Gruntilda's defeat. While Banjo and Kazooie are eating pizza, playing video games and listening to the radio, they discover Gruntilda's detached head returning to Spiral Mountain. They are about to fight when they are stopped by Lord of Games (L.O.G.). He attempts to settle the conflict between the two by devising a series of worlds and challenges. He uses his powers to give Gruntilda an artificial body and to restore the duo's physical fitness, but not their moves from previous games. \n \nL.O.G. transports the characters to Showdown Town, his headquarters, and starts the contest. The winner would be set to own Spiral Mountain; the loser must endure eternal hardship at L.O.G.'s video game factory. While Banjo and Kazooie seek to win by completing the challenges, Gruntilda uses her powers and abilities to try to stop the duo. An army of mechanical Gruntbots also assist the witch in her goal. The game ends with Gruntilda and Banjo attempting to face a final duel when L.O.G. once again comes in to stop them. After L.O.G. sends Gruntilda off to toil away at his video game factory, he rewards Banjo and Kazooie by restoring their moves and giving them the deeds to Spiral Mountain. Gruntilda vows that bringing her to the factory was a mistake and that she will make her own video game.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":10,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:41 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:41 pm","_id":"b9c1d210877b4fa8b3bb355f512349bb","name":"Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also included as part of the Rare Replay collection of games"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts","details":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also included as part of the Rare Replay collection of games"],"id":"x36047","igdbId":3008,"gbId":20586,"gbGuid":"3030-20586","tgdbId":14169,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}],"special":[{"value":"Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Also included as part of the Rare Replay collection of games","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Racing","Adventure"],"id":3008,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Racing, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"03/23/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-03-23T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"15939","price":10.62,"name":"Banjo-Kazooie Nuts & Bolts","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"03/21/2011","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ew8mfgvpxhgc2gp7nvl5.jpg","description":"The Epic edition includes: Bulletstorm // Gears of War 3 beta invitation // 25,000 XP bonus for multiplayer // Access to the following in-game items: Golden leash, Peace Maker Carbine skin, Boot decal, Character armour.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:42 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:42 pm","_id":"6587b6375c28451f9d25205aa60d56bc","name":"Bulletstorm: Epic Edition","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":47481,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"03/23/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-03-23T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"31046","price":6.53,"name":"Bulletstorm [Epic Edition]","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"02/18/2013","total_rating":75,"esrb":"M","videos":["lAOaKmuavsQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28p6.jpg","description":"The award-winning developer Crytek is back with Crysis 3, the first blockbuster shooter of 2013!

Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars.  Players can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":10,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","_id":"b483bde39e644679b86f1f24f4de534f","name":"Forza Motorsport 4","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Forza Motorsport 4","details":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"id":"x360284","igdbId":3068,"gbId":33400,"gbGuid":"3030-33400","tgdbId":8864,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"id":3068,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Racing, Simulator, Sport","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"03/23/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-03-23T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","id":"31818","price":9.71,"name":"Forza Motorsport 4","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/16/2005","total_rating":68,"esrb":"M","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dqm.jpg","description":"The Xbox 360 prequel to Rare's Nintendo 64 hit, Perfect Dark.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.  The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-02-16","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","_id":"b7cac09307d44165bad3fe268744f7dc","name":"Crackdown 2","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.  HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.  HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.  An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.  Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.  Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-02-07","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"PS Plus free game","createdAt":"03/20/2020 09:07 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 09:07 pm","_id":"d7aadd7526524ff4a7fcf64639385f38","name":"HITMAN","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"id":11157,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Tactical, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"first_release_date":"02/19/2007","total_rating":78,"esrb":"M","videos":["YBg0lOlSQpQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w65.jpg","description":"Crackdown is an open world, third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360. Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","story":"Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three crime organizations: Los Muertos (which means \"the dead\" in Spanish), of Central American origin; an Eastern European gang, the Volk (Russian for Wolf) ; and the formerly above-board Shai-Gen Corporation, from East Asia. Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \"the Agency\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \"Agents\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. \nThroughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders and subordinates of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-02-06","howAcquired":"XBOX Store","notes":"Free to celebrate Crackdown 3 coming out soon","createdAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","updatedAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","_id":"d5ea00afab3c47c7b234fc4bf8c31d4e","name":"Crackdown","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

The story unfolds as Daxter searches for Jak, who was imprisoned during the events that led to the start of \"Jak II.\" Daxter, now on his own in an unfamiliar place, quickly realizes that being small and furry won't help his chances of survival. To help stamp out a mysterious metalbug infestation, Daxter takes on a job as a pest exterminator, enabling him to explore parts of Haven City in an effort to collect the clues that will lead him to Jak. Daxter allows gamers to play from his perspective offering a distinctive set of moves with agile abilities that allows players to climb walls, creep up on enemies, fit in small places and maneuver vehicles. Taking a job as a pest exterminator, to fight an ongoing invasion of metal-bugs, Daxter comes equip with gadgets to rid the city of these metal nuisances. Get close up and personal by using your flimsy bug swatter to squash an army of attacking insects or your spray gun to hover around a variety of environments while picking up various upgrades.","story":"The game takes place in the final months of the 2-year gap presented in the opening of Jak II (and the aftermath of The Precursor Legacy), between the moment when Jak is taken prisoner by the Krimzon Guard and the time in which Daxter finally rescues him from the Krimzon Guard Fortress. The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as 'Metal Bugs'. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter's interest in her, occasionally helps him. \n \nAfter completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter's pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo's son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis' palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader. \n \nWhen Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter's Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess and Taryn.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2019-01-26","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","updatedAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","_id":"9f7c8e517a2a448bbd18d30041fc84f2","name":"Daxter","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive","Sony PSP Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Daxter","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive","Sony PSP Greatest Hits"],"id":"spsp65","igdbId":1533,"gbId":14604,"gbGuid":"3030-14604","tgdbId":7078,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PSP Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}}],"isLaunchTitle":false},{"name":"Daxter","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp62","igdbId":1533,"gbId":14604,"gbGuid":"3030-14604","tgdbId":7078,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform","Simulator","Strategy"],"id":1533,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Simulator, Strategy","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"psp","purchaseDate":"01/26/2019","newDatePurchased":"2019-01-26T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"PSP","id":"8816","price":9.77,"name":"Daxter","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/20/2000","total_rating":78,"esrb":"T","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tak.jpg","description":"Sarge's Heroes 2 starts where Sarge's Heroes left off.

A daring adventure awaits Link in Hyrule, where he can use his new ability to become a “drawing” and move along walls of dungeons. This opens up ways to explore and puzzle elements that give Link access to locations he could not otherwise reach.","story":"The events of A Link Between Worlds take place six generations after the events of A Link to the Past. The legend of the legendary hero's battles against Ganon has been passed down from generation to generation, and peace has ruled for decades. The game's incarnation of Link is an apprentice blacksmith to Hyrule's greatest Blacksmith. \n \nBeset by a nightmare of the sacred Triforce being destroyed and facing a gargantuan evil creature, Link is awakened from his sleep by Gulley, the Blacksmith's son. Link rushes over to the smithery, where the Captain of Hyrule's knights has stopped by to retrieve his sword and shield. After Link is scolded for being late, the Blacksmith's Wife notices that the Captain forgot to bring his sword along with him when he left. Link is tasked with traveling to Hyrule Castle to return it to its rightful owner. Once Link arrives at the castle however, he is told that the Captain went to the Sanctuary. Upon his arrival there, however, the villain Yuga appears, and turns both Seres and the Captain into paintings with his wicked magic.

It is the second game in the Soul series, preceded by Soul Edge (1996). Originally released in arcades in 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. In 1999 it was ported to the Dreamcast with improved graphics and new features. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is one of the most critically acclaimed fighting games of all time.","story":"The mystical sword of the legends, the \"Soul Edge\", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years, he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \"Evil Seed\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake. \n \nThree years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them, three sacred weapons join once again.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2018-12-27","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","updatedAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","_id":"3615c618feef470bbc8674bebb5226a3","name":"SoulCalibur","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"SoulCalibur","id":"sdc92","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":1564,"gbId":12411,"gbGuid":"3030-12411","tgdbId":7767,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]},{"name":"SoulCalibur","id":"sdc60","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":1564,"gbId":12411,"gbGuid":"3030-12411","tgdbId":7767,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"id":1564,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Arcade","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"12/27/2018","newDatePurchased":"2018-12-27T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"10397","price":21.54,"name":"Soul Calibur","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1987","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gsl.jpg","description":"The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam.

The game features creatures known as Flickies, which first appeared in the 1984 arcade game Flicky. Controlling only Sonic himself, the player's goal is to collect Flickies and carry them to safety, periodically sparring with the series antagonist Dr. Robotnik, who is imprisoning them within robots.","story":"Doctor Robotnik discovers mysterious birds called Flickies that live on an island in an alternate dimension. He learns that they can travel anywhere using large rings, so he decides to exploit them by turning them into robots to help him search for the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic arrives at the island only to discover the presence of Robotnik, and he is tasked with saving the Flickies and defeating his nemesis. \n \nSonic travels through the island, saving the Flickies and clashing with Robotnik in his various machines.

Shortly after, Sonic and Tails in their biplane, the Tornado, are in search of Dr. Robotnik. Sonic, possessing the emeralds from the events of Sonic 2, then turns into Super Sonic.

It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and, the following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.Killer Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-doubles\", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.","story":"Ultratech is a very powerful megacorporation which organises a tournament called Killer Instinct. Along with regular participants, experimental creatures created by Ultratech also fight in the tournament so their strength can be tested. Ultratech also discovers a technology to make bridges between dimensions, and releases a two-headed, one-eyed, satyr monster called Eyedol from this dimensional prison.","player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)","consoleId":19,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":13.99,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2017-04-06","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"11/16/2018 02:07 pm","updatedAt":"11/16/2018 02:07 pm","_id":"4f66118895a94dd1833cf7230ea6d7cf","name":"Killer Instinct","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting"],"id":2907,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bitbox","purchaseDate":"04/06/2017","newDatePurchased":"2017-04-06T05:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Super Nintendo","id":"7365","price":17.05,"name":"Killer Instinct","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/31/2011","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","videos":["tV1Osnkr5Nc","ulNcEJA3pXQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zvv.jpg","description":"Celebrate 20 years of Sonic in an all new adventure that delivers a definitive experience to Sonic fans new and old!

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.  The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...  Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.  Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.  Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)","consoleId":19,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":7.5,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2017-03-09","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"11/16/2018 02:05 pm","updatedAt":"11/16/2018 02:05 pm","_id":"b6a996dcc7a54307838e62635a40aef5","name":"Uniracers","extraData":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Uniracers","details":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System exclusive"],"id":"snes423","igdbId":16743,"gbId":16228,"gbGuid":"3030-16228","tgdbId":2212,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)","id":"ccl2","igdbId":19,"gbId":9,"gbGuid":"3045-9","tgdbId":6}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"name":"Uniracers","details":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System exclusive"],"id":"snes411","igdbId":16743,"gbId":16228,"gbGuid":"3030-16228","tgdbId":2212,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)","id":"ccl2","igdbId":19,"gbId":9,"gbGuid":"3045-9","tgdbId":6}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing"],"id":16743,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"-1","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Racing","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bitbox","purchaseDate":"03/09/2017","newDatePurchased":"2017-03-09T06:00:00.000Z","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Super Nintendo","id":"7224","price":17.92,"name":"Uniracers","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/aaeaxuuhdeguqwy5uf8e.jpg","description":"The destruction of the Barrax Empire...A Whirling Barra ship darts out from the recesses of a dark spiral cave and attacks from the left.

Inside, he meets Dracula's servant Death (Dennis Falt; Travis Willingham in the redub), who warns him to stop his quest to destroy the castle and strips him of his equipment. He also meets Maria Renard (Kimberly Forsythe; Michelle Ruff in the redub), a seventeen-year-old vampire hunter who fought alongside Richter and is now searching for him, and the castle's librarian, who sells items and equipment to Alucard. Periodically encountering Maria throughout the castle, Alucard also meets Richter, who claims to be the new lord of the castle and forces him to battle with two monsters. \n \nAlucard defeats the monsters, finds Maria again, and tells her about Richter. Upset, she leaves Alucard to confirm it for herself. Convinced that Richter is under somebody else's control, Maria meets Alucard again; she urges him not to hurt Richter and gives him an item that allows him to see past illusions. In the castle's keep, Alucard confronts Richter and learns that he plans to resurrect Dracula so he may battle the vampire for eternity. Alucard breaks the spell controlling Richter. Dracula's servant Shaft (Jeff Manning; Tony Oliver in the redub) appears and reveals that despite the spell being broken, Dracula will be resurrected soon. Shaft summons an inverted version of the castle. \n \nAlucard leaves Richter to Maria's care and enters the inverted castle to find and destroy Shaft. Along the way, he defeats Death and eventually finds Shaft. Shaft admits he planned to end the threat of the Belmont clan by controlling one as the master of the castle and forcing them to fight each other. Alucard defeats Shaft, who reveals that Dracula's resurrection is complete. Alucard faces his own father, who vows to destroy humankind because Alucard's mother Lisa was executed as a witch. Alucard refuses to join his father in his revenge and the two battle. Alucard defeats his father and suggests he lost the battle because he lost his ability to love after Lisa's death. Dracula quotes the biblical verse Matthew 16:26 (in the dub) and learns that Lisa's final words were of eternal love for him and a plea not to hate – or at least harm – humanity. \n \nAs Dracula vanishes, he asks for Lisa's forgiveness and bids his son farewell. Escaping the crumbling castle, Alucard rejoins Maria and Richter. Maria expresses relief that he escaped while Richter blames himself as the reason for Alucard's fight with his father. Alucard tells Richter, \"the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing,\" (an attributed quote from Edmund Burke) and resolves to disappear from the world because of his cursed bloodline. Depending on how much of the castle the player has explored, Maria either chases Alucard in the hope of changing his mind, or resigns herself to Alucard's fate and leaves with Richter.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Xbox One","consoleId":49,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"XBOX Live","notes":"","createdAt":"03/21/2020 08:52 am","updatedAt":"03/21/2020 08:52 am","_id":"ef1f90e0f3b94e6e9843404c997edf30","name":"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":1128,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"first_release_date":"01/24/2018","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["7XKSMt7NW6Q","I2sxnLe_yTk","37njFGz8efs","FqBj2IGg6Uw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1vcd.jpg","description":"A single-player platformer about climbing a mountain.

Stand up to the cult’s leader, Joseph Seed and the Heralds, and spark the fires of resistance that will liberate the besieged community.    In this expansive world, your limits and creativity will be tested against the biggest and most ruthless baddest enemy Far Cry has ever seen. It’ll be wild and it’ll get weird, but as long as you keep your wits about you, the residents of Hope County can rest assured knowing you’re their beacon of hope.","story":"The game is set in the fictional Hope County, Montana, where a preacher named Joseph Seed has risen to prominence in the region. Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an \"inevitable collapse\" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the federal government for help. When an attempt to arrest Seed ends with the deaths of several lawmen, the player is swept into the armed conflict between Eden's Gate and the remaining Hope County residents who are organizing themselves into a resistance movement. The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed. Seed has assumed the title of \"the Father\" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of his siblings, known as \"the Heralds\": Jacob, a former military officer that oversees their armed soldiers; John, a lawyer that has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate; and Faith, who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to believe and trust in her older brother. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Target","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 06:02 am","updatedAt":"02/04/2019 06:57 am","_id":"f4110f5c0f874a92b2cbc3c2698dfc06","name":"Far Cry 5","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure","FPS"],"id":28552,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","id":"45695","price":10.31,"name":"Far Cry 5","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/28/2017","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","videos":["l1FJfr_spJQ","z_7Gz_RFLnE","GbK_Xw5BiSw","3Ty4064UZ_c"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1uxd.jpg","description":"Powered by Frostbite™, EA SPORTS™ FIFA 18 blurs the line between the virtual and real worlds, bringing to life the players, teams, and atmospheres that immerse you in the emotion of The World’s Game.

Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features.","story":"Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. \nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. \nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. \nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. \nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. \nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. \nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"03/20/2020 08:51 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 08:51 pm","_id":"c9ac9c2c3ea049e29e5bdf9911bc14d4","name":"Battlefield 4","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 4 launch title","Sony PlayStation 4 Greatest Hits","banned in China: Banned for discrediting China's national image as well as threatening national security.

Tasked with stopping Dante by Kyrie's brother Credo, the Captain of the Holy Knights, Nero's journey leads him to discover that he is in fact a descendant of Sparda himself, and Dante is not his enemy. Under orders from Sanctus, Agnus, has been siphoning the power of the long lost Devil Arm Yamato, the sword of Dante's brother Vergil, to create a demonic army, and imbue high-ranking members of the Order with demonic power. To Agnus' shock, the shattered Yamato restores itself in Nero's presence, and flies to Nero's aid. With The Order's plans revealed, Agnus flees to inform the newly resurrected Sanctus. \n \nAs Nero sets his sights on The Order, he discovers to his dismay that Credo is part of the conspiracy, until he ends up being deceived as well when they witness Kyrie being kidnapped by a newly revived Sanctus. He intends to use a creature known as Savior to defeat the demon army he's created, as a means of strengthening the people's worship of Sparda. With the Sparda Sword already in his possession, and needing the blood of a descendant of Sparda along with the Yamato, Sanctus captures Nero to power The Savior's core. Dante arrives, with Trish, who was revealed to be a spy within The Order, and makes a promise to the dying Credo to save Nero and Kyrie. Splitting up, Trish evacuates Fortuna's human residents, while Dante destroys all the Hell Gates scattered over Fortuna, and defeats Agnus, reclaiming the Yamato sword for the last time. Confronting the Savior in a sky battle above Fortuna, Dante drives the Yamato through The Savior's chest, where Nero recovers it inside, freeing himself and Kyrie, and defeating Sanctus. \n \nNero is able to make peace with the power it has given him to protect those he cares about. Before Dante leaves, he decides to entrust Nero with the Yamato, and Kyrie and Nero share their first kiss in the ruins of Fortuna. Back at Dante's office, Lady arrives. As previously revealed in the game, it was Lady who sent Dante and Trish to Fortuna in the first place as The Order had begun butting in on some of her jobs, which was why Trish immediately went undercover to expose The Order's true colours.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"03/20/2020 08:57 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 08:57 pm","_id":"5dd398cb8efe45c1ab1ff65dd6926e22","name":"Devil May Cry 4","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"id":112,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"first_release_date":"10/26/2015","total_rating":88,"esrb":"M","videos":["Ej5-71re0mU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2axo.jpg","description":"Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition Edition is a much lauded Role-Playing-Game that blends deep customization and humor with dynamic turn based combat.

The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Nate's boat, but Nate's friend and mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) rescues the two in his seaplane. Fearing Elena's reporting will attract potential rivals, Nate and Sully abandon her at a dock. \n \nFollowing the diary to the indicated spot, Nate and Sully discover an alcove that once held a large statue, and realize that El Dorado is not a city but rather a golden idol. They find a Nazi U-boat, which contains a page from Drake's diary showing the statue was taken to an island. However, mercenaries led by criminal Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman) and his lieutenant Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes) intercept Nate and Sully. Sully is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest, but Nate manages to escape, encounters Elena, and flies with her to the island. \n \nOn the way, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Nate to bail out and they are separated. After retrieving supplies from the wrecked seaplane, Nate heads toward an old fort to find Elena. Briefly captured by pirates led by old associate Eddy Raja (James Sie), Elena breaks Nate free and they flee to the island's old customs house. After finding records showing the statue was moved further inland, they find that Sully is alive and accompanying Roman and Raja. Nate and Elena find and rescue Sully who, having survived due to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, explains he was buying time for Nate by giving Roman misinformation. \n \n \nUncharted 2: \nTwo years after the events of the first game, treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Nolan North) is approached by former associate Harry Flynn (Steve Valentine) and Flynn's girlfriend Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) to help steal a Mongolian oil lamp connected to Marco Polo's doomed 1292 voyage from China. The group plans to cheat Flynn's client and take Polo's treasure for themselves. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Nate had worked together before, and Chloe plans on blackmailing Flynn and escaping with Nate and whatever treasure they find. \n \nNate and Flynn break into a museum in Istanbul and find the lamp, which contains a map and flammable resin that reveals Polo's fleet was shipwrecked in Borneo, and was carrying the Cintamani Stone from the fabled city of Shambhala. Flynn double-crosses Nate, leaving him to be arrested. \n \nThree months later, Chloe helps free Nate with his longtime friend Victor Sullivan (Richard McGonagle). She reveals that Flynn is working for Zoran Lazarević (Graham McTavish), a Serbian war criminal seeking the stone. In Borneo, Nate and Sully infiltrate Lazarević's camp, with Chloe as a mole. Nate discovers that the stone never left Shambhala, and locates a temple containing the bodies of Polo's crew, as well as a phurba and map detailing that its carrier will gain passage to Shambhala through a temple in Nepal. Nate and Sully escape after being cornered by Flynn and his men. \n \n \nUncharted 3: \nThe story begins with Nathan \"Nate\" Drake (Nolan North) and Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) entering a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot (Robin Atkin Downes), who is interested in purchasing Nate's ring. During the meeting, Nate and Sully accuse Talbot of offering them counterfeit banknotes, and a fight ensues. After fighting their way past Talbot's thugs, Nate and Sully emerge in an alleyway, where they are surrounded and subdued by Charlie Cutter (Graham McTavish), Talbot's cohort. They are then approached by Talbot's client, Katherine Marlowe (Rosalind Ayres), who steals Drake's ring. Nate attempts to go after her, but Cutter guns him and Sully down, seemingly killing them. \n \nThe story flashes back to 20 years earlier, where a teenage Nathan Drake (Billy Unger) explores a museum in Cartagena, Colombia, in search of Sir Francis Drake's ring, but is thrown out after guards suspect him of being a thief.

The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","story":"While having a walk in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario, Toad and Peach, and Luigi happen on one of the many green pipes, yet a special one. A fairy, which they'll learn is Princess Sprixie, comes out. Bowser is chasing after her, though: he kidnaps her and vanishes through the pipe. Mario and the friends of his can't but promptly jump into the pipe, and they find themselves in the Sprinxie Kingdom, tasked with rescuing the princess.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 05:53 am","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 05:53 am","_id":"0a6b32d6a27244b5bca01e777debbec7","name":"Super Mario 3D World","extraData":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive","Wii U Nintendo Select"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Mario 3D World","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive","Wii U Nintendo Select"],"id":"wiiu358","igdbId":2180,"gbId":42931,"gbGuid":"3030-42931","tgdbId":18153,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"special":[{"value":"Wii U Nintendo Select","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}}],"isLaunchTitle":false},{"name":"Super Mario 3D World","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"id":"wiiu353","igdbId":2180,"gbId":42931,"gbGuid":"3030-42931","tgdbId":18153,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":2180,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Wii U","id":"34615","price":12.92,"name":"Super Mario 3D World","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/09/2015","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","videos":["NLS458ekSEI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21vl.jpg","description":"Super Mario Maker lets people’s imaginations run wild.

The Wii U GamePad controller makes it so easy for anyone to create levels; it may feel like simply sketching out ideas on paper. Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world.  The game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","_id":"fc0d9032824e4f21836d8348df9bd516","name":"Super Mario Maker","extraData":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Mario Maker","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"id":"wiiu359","igdbId":7339,"gbId":46580,"gbGuid":"3030-46580","tgdbId":31277,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"name":"Super Mario Maker","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"id":"wiiu354","igdbId":7339,"gbId":46580,"gbGuid":"3030-46580","tgdbId":31277,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform"],"id":7339,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Wii U","id":"35958","price":12.42,"name":"Super Mario Maker","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/20/2014","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["nb1m_wyB4bM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co213x.jpg","description":"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is the fourth console-based entry in the popular Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games.

With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus.

Taking the King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"came with PSP when bought from Kershawna","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 03:47 pm","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 03:47 pm","_id":"e8fc820fd19b41a6a7d24df57e61841d","name":"God of War: Chains of Olympus","extraData":["Sony PSP Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"God of War: Chains of Olympus","details":["Sony PSP Greatest Hits"],"id":"spsp107","igdbId":552,"gbId":20592,"gbGuid":"3030-20592","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PSP Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"id":552,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"psp","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"PSP","id":"12962","price":14.73,"name":"God of War Chains of Olympus","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/31/1994","total_rating":84,"esrb":"E10+","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25zx.jpg","description":"One year has passed since eight of the toughest, fastest fighters challenged each other in the World Fighting Tournament. \t\t\t\t\t Now the call has come for the second World Fighting Tournament.

It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.  is the first update to the game. The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four.  Champion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity. One in particular is Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition. Champion Edition was followed by Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Excellent","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"11/17/2018 11:34 am","updatedAt":"11/17/2018 11:34 am","_id":"f76ab328e3c34e7da7c7a5b07d0f437b","name":"Street Fighter II: Champion Edition","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting"],"id":39496,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"2","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Genesis","id":"9868","price":9.25,"name":"Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/08/2003","total_rating":40,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/j94dlnlojutwzsfkt0af.jpg","description":"Race against the clock as you pick up passengers and white-knuckle it through busy streets and back alleys.

Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all. \n \nOnce the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World. \n \nThe Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered. Hawke takes over as leader of Black Hole, and along with Flak, Lash, and Adder, leaves Macro Land with the few troops he has left.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 03:23 pm","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 03:23 pm","_id":"1b4ccaf882c84291a426572c5ecefd45","name":"Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)","Tactical"],"id":1692,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS), Tactical","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ds","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"GameBoy Advance","id":"1970","price":34,"name":"Advance Wars 2","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/19/2001","total_rating":75,"esrb":"E","videos":["cLTXX0qu63w","aCbbdS5t8nU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1upk.jpg","description":"Sonic Advance is notable for being the first Sonic game released on a Nintendo console, despite both Sega and Nintendo being well-known rivals on the console market throught the 1990s.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past revives the classic SNES game on the Game Boy Advance and adds a new multiplayer mode. In a Link to the Past, Link travels between the light world and the dark world, conquering fierce monsters and uncovering Hyrule's deepest secrets along the way. Also included is Four Swords, which lets you play with up to three other players, slashing through dungeons and collecting rupees. Whether you choose solo or competitive play, The Legend of Zelda will keep you occupied with its brain-bending puzzles and fun swashbuckling action.","story":"In A Link to the Past \nThe intro to A Link to the Past reveals the back story of the game, showing that series antagonist Ganon was sealed away after his bid for the Triforce. However, the seal has grown weak, and a wizard named Agahnim has taken over the throne of Hyrule, and is kidnapping the seven descendants of the Sages who sealed away Ganon, which includes Princess Zelda. The game opens with series protagonist Link receiving a message from Zelda, telling him to come save her. Following his Uncle, he finds him near death, and is tasked by his Uncle to find and rescue Zelda, giving him his sword and shield before dying. After Link reaches the dungeons, he frees Zelda from her cage, and takes her through a hidden sewer into a Sanctuary, where she remains hidden. The man in the Sanctuary tells Link of Agahnim's plan to break the seal the Sages placed, requiring Link to obtain the Master Sword. Link travels across Hyrule, aided by a man named Sahasrahla, collecting three pendants from the three dungeons, using them to unseal the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. Link returns to Hyrule Castle with the Master Sword after Zelda is kidnapped. When he meets Agahnim, he finds that he is too late, as Agahnim teleports her away. \n \nAfter battling and defeating Agahnim, he takes Link into the Sacred Realm, which has been corrupted and transformed into the Dark World by Ganon. He is tasked with rescuing the seven Maidens who have been sealed away in crystals, as well as finding magical items called the Silver Arrows. Link eventually rescues Zelda, and uses the Maidens' power to break into Ganon's Tower. After fighting and defeating Agahnim for the second time, Ganon flies from Agahnim's corpse into the Pyramid of Power. Link follows, doing battle with him. He eventually defeats Ganon, and finds the Triforce. After the Triforce speaks to Link, Link uses it to wish for Hyrule to return to normal. Afterward, he returns the Master Sword to where he found it. If the player has completed Four Swords, they may find an alternate ending by beating a secret dungeon. This dungeon features four Dark Links, in reference to the four Links in the Four Swords game. After defeating them, an ending showing the inhabitants of the Dark World and the various bosses is shown. \n \nIn Four Swords \nTaking place before the events of Ocarina of Time, the prologue shows Link and Zelda approaching a sword in a pedestal, called the Four Sword. After Zelda explains its history and the creature sealed within it, the creature named Vaati breaks free, capturing Zelda to marry her. Link is encountered by three fairies who instruct Link to pull the Four Sword out. Link pulls the Four Sword out, inadvertently creating three copies of himself that fight alongside him. As the game begins, the four Links are tasked with finding four Great Fairies, who together will grant them access to Vaati's palace. After finding the four Great Fairies and entering the palace the Links battle Vaati. After Vaati is thoroughly weakened, he is trapped in the Four Sword. Zelda and Link return the Four Sword back in its pedestal.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 03:29 pm","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 03:29 pm","_id":"54d72568c2824bf0b503028535c4e63e","name":"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords","extraData":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance Player's Choice"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords","details":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance Player's Choice"],"id":"gba256","igdbId":77336,"gbId":35064,"gbGuid":"3030-35064","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance Player's Choice","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","id":"ccl10","igdbId":24,"gbId":4,"gbGuid":"3045-4","tgdbId":5}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":[],"id":77336,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":true,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ds","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"GameBoy Advance","id":"2727","price":25,"name":"Zelda Link to the Past","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"03/20/2001","total_rating":81,"esrb":"E","videos":["LG4aa39d9qM","FxJR-1XIfSo"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21r7.jpg","description":"An updated re-release of Super Mario Bros. 2 (the American reskin of \"Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic,\" later re-released in Japan as \"Super Mario USA\") as a Game Boy Advance launch title.

They must stop Doctor Eggman from stealing the seven Chaos Emeralds and feeding them to Chaos, a monster known as \"the God of Destruction\". The first in the Sonic the Hedgehog series to feature free-roaming 3D gameplay, Sonic Adventure features two game modes: Adventure and Trial. There are different goals for each character in the game: Sonic involves high speed gameplay, while Tails must reach the end of the level before Sonic does, and Knuckles searches the area for shards of the Master Emerald. Each of the three characters retain many of their trademark moves from previous Sonic games, such as Tails being able to fly for short periods of time, and Knuckles being able to glide through the air, though they can use updated techniques as well. The rest of the playable cast is rounded out by Amy, who must use her hammer to escape from Eggman's E-100 Zero robot chasing after her, Gamma, who must use its laser beam to shoot through levels to reach a target, and Big, who fishes in efforts to find his friend, Froggy.  The \"Adventure Mode\" is a one-player game which consists of two areas, the \"Adventure Field\" and an \"Action Stage\". The Adventure Field contains several \"Events\" that are encountered in the course of the story, while the Action Stages have each character fulfilling a goal to clear the stage. Players may also find hidden Chao Gardens, a protective environment inhabited by Chao, a sort of virtual pet. The player can hatch, raise and interact with a Chao. Chao can be taken with the player by downloading the minigame Chao Adventure to their VMU, or in the GameCube version, a Game Boy Advance with Sonic Advance or various other Game Boy Advance Sonic games. The player can also raise their stats by giving them small animals that they found by defeating the robots, which improves their performance in Chao Races. There are also eggs hidden throughout the Adventure Fields which can produce special types of Chao.  By playing through Action Stages and Subgames, searching through the Adventure Fields or winning Chao Races, players can earn Emblems. In the case of Action Stages, each one has three Emblems, which can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling certain objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.","story":"Sonic Adventure is set on Angel Island, an island floating above Earth. The Ancient Echidna Tribe's ruler, Pachacamac, plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe attack the shrine, attempting to use the emeralds for their own gain. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos and kills them. Following Chaos' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald. \n \nThree thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik shatters the Master Emerald and sets Chaos free. As a result, Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In the city of Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog battles Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles \"Tails\" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' Emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails resolve to search for the emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Eggman and Chaos. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, and shoots down Sonic and Tails' pursuing plane. \n \nEggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training. He orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos's tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy's owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird in possession of a Chaos Emerald and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie's location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdie and detains them both on the Egg Carrier, with Sonic and Tails using the Tornado II to follow them on board. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald. \n \nOn board the Egg Carrier, Eggman calls out the E-Series robots for their failure and removes them before stationing Gamma in Amy's cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt and Amy convinces Gamma that he should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship's deck. She meets up with Sonic and Tails, but Eggman appears and steals Birdie's emerald, dispatching Gamma to attack Sonic. Sonic damages Gamma, but Amy intervenes and asks Sonic to spares him. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, now with six Chaos Emeralds and his tail restored, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Big retrieves Froggy from inside Chaos before finding the Tornado II, and Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds; they both flee from the ship as it crashes. \n \nUpon erasing his master registration, Gamma resolves to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Gamma defeats him, but the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed, with Birdie's parents being released from within the two. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. Amy defeats the robot and sees Birdie and his family off, vowing to do her best. Elsewhere, Tails chases Eggman and stops him from detonating a missile in the middle of Station Square. Eggman resorts to using the Egg Walker to try and level the city, but is again defeated by Tails. Later, Sonic confronts the mad scientist in his Egg Viper and destroys it. \n \nA day following Eggman's defeats, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, draining the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a massive flood. The Chaos Emeralds are re-gathered by Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and the pink Flicky that fueled Gamma. They bring the emeralds to Sonic. \n \nTikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Instead, with the cheering of his friends and the people of Station Square, Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following his defeat, Chaos discovers that the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling his anger. United with Tikal, Chaos ascends into the heavens and disappears. The game ends with Sonic chasing after a fleeing Eggman.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","_id":"c41a04fe4a9a41a2a834c5a8e4df8ee1","name":"Sonic Adventure","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title","Sega All-Stars game (NA)"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Sonic Adventure","id":"sdc89","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title","Sega All-Stars game (NA)"],"igdbId":7860,"gbId":7852,"gbGuid":"3030-7852","tgdbId":2416,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"special":[{"value":"Sega All-Stars game (NA)","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}}],"isExclusive":false},{"name":"Sonic Adventure","id":"sdc57","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":7860,"gbId":7852,"gbGuid":"3030-7852","tgdbId":2416,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":7860,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"9779","price":29,"name":"Sonic Adventure","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/19/2000","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","videos":["ADFhiXzBeRg","L7Q4lr4312o"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y77.jpg","description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game.

The city of Venice becomes chaotic when a strange zombie breakout takes place. American AMS agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched, along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris, to investigate and evacuate the populace. They suddenly encounter the impish Zeal, who had recently dealt with G. Upon finding G alive but wounded, James and Gary converse with him and G gives them a field journal showing the bosses and weak points.

They continue on, trying to save the town's civilians from the zombies.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:28 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:28 am","_id":"92e4d03b98ee4ee8b7006ee0e4a7ff76","name":"The House of the Dead 2","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title","Sega All-Stars game (NA)"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The House of the Dead 2","id":"sdc101","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title","Sega All-Stars game (NA)"],"igdbId":13777,"gbId":422,"gbGuid":"3030-422","tgdbId":3961,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"special":[{"value":"Sega All-Stars game (NA)","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}}],"isExclusive":false},{"name":"The House of the Dead 2","id":"sdc67","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":13777,"gbId":422,"gbGuid":"3030-422","tgdbId":3961,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":13777,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"cd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"9984","price":19.99,"name":"The House of the Dead 2","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/08/1999","videos":["Vyf5apHXqic"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ny.jpg","description":"The first and only Mortal Kombat title to make onto the Dreamcast console, Mortal Kombat Gold offered players a carbon-copy of the arcade edition of Mortal Kombat 4, along with additional features and characters never before included in the arcade game.

Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get. \n \nF-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off. \n \nFalcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil. \n \nAt his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","_id":"0d78a523fa284c2e85dbeb33a9d7ecc6","name":"F-Zero GX","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive","Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc31","name":"F-Zero X","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive","Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice"],"igdbId":3492,"gbId":20448,"gbGuid":"3030-20448","tgdbId":10836,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"special":[{"value":"Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}}],"isLaunchTitle":false},{"id":"ngc24","name":"F-Zero X","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3492,"gbId":20448,"gbGuid":"3030-20448","tgdbId":10836,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing"],"id":3492,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Racing","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Gamecube","id":"3303","price":85.16,"name":"F-Zero GX","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/12/2002","total_rating":89,"esrb":"E","videos":["RxMos9muPYQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1nqu.jpg","description":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is the 10th sequel of the Legend of Zelda action-adventure series.

Packed to the gills with exploration, creative power-ups, and wicked enemies, Metroid Prime is a first-person adventure worthy of the Metroid stamp. An action-packed adventure set in the first-person perspective, Metroid Prime takes place just after the events in the original Metroid (NES). It has lead character Samus Aran, a bounty hunter by trade, chasing down the evil Space Pirates. Their intention is to use a genetic mutagen called Phazon to create a super army and take over the universe.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.  The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.  The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","story":"King Sharaman of Persia and his son, known only as the Prince, pass through India en route to Azad and conquer a city with the aid of the local Maharajah's traitorous Vizier. During the battle the Prince seeks to win honour and glory in his first battle and heads straight to the Maharajah's treasure vaults, where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time, which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount. When the Prince presents the dagger to his father, the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment, but is refused by King Sharaman. The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth of prisoners taken from the Maharajah, among them the Maharajah's beautiful daughter, Princess Farah. \n \nIn Azad, the Vizier, now in the service of King Sharaman, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to release the Sands of Time from the Hourglass. A horrific sandstorm engulfs the kingdom and the Sands of Time turn all the occupants of the palace into monsters. Only the Prince, Farah, and the Vizier remain unchanged due to their possessions; a dagger, a medallion, and a staff, respectively. Amid the catastrophe, the Vizier demands the dagger from the Prince, who refuses and manages to escape. \n \nThe Prince soon teams up with Farah in an attempt to return the Sands of Time to the Hourglass, which the Vizier moves to the top of the Tower of Dawn. As they progress through the palace the pair are constantly waylaid by Sand Monsters (including a sand-possessed King Sharaman) and the deadly network of traps set in motion in the hopes of killing the creatures. The Prince becomes steadily more worn until his princely armor is mere shreds and his body covered in bloody wounds. \n \nWhile initially the Prince does not trust Farah because of the Persians' mistreatment of her, the two begin to grow closer as time goes on After a terrific battle in the ascent of the Tower of Dawn, they reach the Hourglass and are about to complete their mission when the Prince hesitates, suddenly suspicious of what Farah's motives really are. Before Farah can convince the Prince otherwise, the Vizier confronts the pair and uses his magical powers to trap Farah and the Prince in a tomb. \n \nAs they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince, who similarly reveals his claustrophobia, a story she had never told anyone before, about a time when she was little, when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her: \"Kakolookia\". \n \nAs soon as the Prince repeats the word, as if by magic, the Prince finds himself in a mysterious tunnel which winds down into a dreamlike bathhouse that resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health. There he meets Farah inviting him to join her bath; as they bathe, the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation. When the Prince awakens afterwards, he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that the magical cavern was just a dream, but he believed that Farah had shared it as well. However Farah, the Dagger, and his sword are gone, leaving him with only Farah's medallion to protect him from the Sands of Time. \n \nThe Prince, having found a new sword which destroys the sand monsters on contact, pursues and catches up to Farah once more atop the Tower of Dawn, which he must climb from the outside. When the Prince finally reaches the top, he finds Farah being overwhelmed by the sand monsters and she dangles over a cliff by the Dagger, while the Prince grab the blade; and Farah, realizing that the Prince will die to save her, instead sacrifices herself and lets go of the Dagger; and true to the game's prophecy \"if you want to live, die in love\" she falls to her death in the Hourglass room below. The Prince then tries to use the dagger to save her, but finds the sand-tanks empty since Farah had used them all. Enraged by his lover's death, the Prince uses the Dagger to massacre the last of the sand monsters in the tower and descends to weep over Farah's body. As the Prince mourns, the Vizier emerges from the shadows and offers the Prince a partnership in his evil plan, promising him eternal life; however the Prince angrily refuses because those he loved had died, and before the Vizier can stop him, the Prince drives the Dagger of Time into the Hourglass, rewinding time to the night before the invasion of the Maharajah's kingdom. The Prince awakens, still with the Dagger of Time, and secretly finds his way to Farah's bedroom, where he tells her the whole story, which she does not remember as it had not happened yet. However, the Vizier discovers the Prince, and fearing his planned treachery already revealed, attempts to kill both Farah and the Prince, telling that he suffered from consumption and would die in any event and that his plan was to cure his imminent death with eternal life. In the ensuing battle the Prince kills the Vizier. He then returns the Dagger of Time to Farah, who asks why the Prince invented such an unbelievable story to prove the Vizier's treachery. The Prince then kisses Farah, hoping she'll remember; but she rebuffs his advance, and so the Prince uses the dagger to erase the kiss, and instead he falsely tells her that it was just a story. But when Farah asks the Prince his name, he replies, \"Just call me Kakolookia\", before departing, leaving Farah amazed.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:44 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:44 pm","_id":"39eb6b8a3edf403bb3eec70a8283e746","name":"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time","details":["Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice"],"id":"ngc107","igdbId":836,"gbId":5235,"gbGuid":"3030-5235","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Nintendo GameCube Player's Choice","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":836,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Gamecube","id":"3487","price":15.6,"name":"Prince of Persia Sands of Time","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"01/10/2005","total_rating":85,"esrb":"M","videos":["t1KsnbqkLec"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20cg.jpg","description":"An atmospheric survival horror game with inventive third-person shooting mechanics set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 (1998), Resident Evil 4 follows Leon S.

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.  The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.  Enemies turn \"angry\" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).

Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race.

After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder.  The player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either, chosen at the start of the game or assigned by control panel. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed.  The eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the attract mode, the game showed the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song.  Most of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself.","story":"Even though Splinter defeated Shredder and Casey Jones attempted to crush him in a garbage truck, Shredder's titanium helmet protected him from certain doom. He awoke on a garbage ship and floated back to land on a raft made out of styrofoam cups that were non-biodegradable. Once on land he began training stronger Foot Soldiers, but they alone were not enough. Shredder, using his translocation matrix beam, then travelled through the universe in search of stronger allies. He recruited a member of the Ultimate Galactic Sword residing in Sector Six of the Oead Star Zone and on the ice planet of Traglodoon he found a bounty hunter named Tora. Together, Shredder, his minions and his two new allies have worked together to kidnap April O'Neil.

As players' characters develop, the world reacts to them and their actions. People comment on their successes, failures, appearances and behaviors. Their many opinions are expressed through applause, mockery, trepidation, panic and even flirtation. With each person characters aid and every creature they slay, the world is changed forever. In Fable, gamers decide: \"Who will I be?\"","story":"On his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","_id":"1f234ccd0f274ddca7c5623d586d230e","name":"Fable","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":521,"name":"Fable","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"id":"mxb1148","gbId":3264,"gbGuid":"3030-3264","tgdbId":6055,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false},{"igdbId":521,"name":"Fable","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"id":"xbox131","gbId":3264,"gbGuid":"3030-3264","tgdbId":6055,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":521,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Xbox","id":"30306","price":5.99,"name":"Fable","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/08/2004","total_rating":82,"esrb":"M","videos":["fkCgDIhUJmQ","XFKoLeOXEDc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1x77.jpg","description":"Halo 2 is the sequel to the highly successful and critically acclaimed Halo: Combat Evolved.

But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat.

Bruce Wayne protests this prison but is shortly kidnapped by the despicable Hugo Strange, thus having to face the city's most powerful villains as the Batman while trying to uncover Strange's plans.","story":"At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence \"Protocol 10\", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10. \n \nThere, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. \n \nTracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. \n \nWhen he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker. \n \nBatman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates \"Protocol 11\", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. \n \nBatman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Walmart","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:31 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:31 am","_id":"f3f70d563b1f4517af2c356573b76e94","name":"Batman: Arkham City","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure"],"id":501,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"31859","price":5.72,"name":"Batman: Arkham City","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"03/01/2010","total_rating":85,"esrb":"M","videos":["Gmcg6F4BeUE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1xbi.jpg","description":"Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected \"Battlefield moments.\"  New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.  \nYears later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail \"Misty\" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.  \nRegardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to \"mend the rift\" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.  \nFollowing their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as \"the Rift\" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.  \nUnbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real. It is ambiguous as to whether the events of the game mode have actually occurred or has all along been simply in Samantha's imagination.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:34 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:34 am","_id":"3931b8477a3d44e28aa4e99e7468391e","name":"Call of Duty: Black Ops II","genres":["Shooter"],"id":1122,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"33320","price":8.92,"name":"Call of Duty Black Ops II","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Call of Duty: Black Ops II","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"id":"sps398","igdbId":1122,"gbId":38039,"gbGuid":"3030-38039","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}]},{"first_release_date":"10/22/2007","total_rating":78,"esrb":"T","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kldzkdkxyoyrmlul2yvg.jpg","description":"Sony Computer Entertainment introduces a new concept in trading card games with THE EYE OF JUDGMENT™ developed exclusively for PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system. Utilizing Hasbro® and its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary's trading card expertise, the immense power of the PS3® system, and the PLAYSTATION®Eye, Sony's groundbreaking next-generation USB camera for PS3, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT provides a visually stunning experience that adds a third dimension to the trading card game genre. Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, JAPAN Studio, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT presents a new style of gameplay where collectable trading cards, embedded with a CyberCode, are brought to life in the 3D game through use of the innovative PLAYSTATION Eye. Players compete by selecting a card and placing the coded card in front of the PLAYSTATION Eye for their respective creatures to come to life and battle on screen. Players take turns placing cards as they jostle for control; the winner is the first player to conquer five of the nine squares of the \"9 Fields\" battle mat. The gamers task is to conquer the board by deploying their cards more skillfully than their opponent. Players have four ways to play THE EYE OF JUDGMENT, single player against their PS3, against an opponent in two-player mode, against an opponent online, or letting the PS3 play out a round with the cards the player owns. THE EYE OF JUDGMENT comes with a starter deck of 30 character and spell cards manufactured by Hasbro.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:35 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:35 am","_id":"c5a544affea34405b9ad4424e71964e4","name":"The Eye of Judgment","genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"id":7302,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS)","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"10377","price":24.83,"name":"Eye of Judgment","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The Eye of Judgment","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive"],"id":"sps3664","igdbId":7302,"gbId":16019,"gbGuid":"3030-16019","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}]},{"first_release_date":"11/16/2009","total_rating":85,"esrb":"M","videos":["CV8rbKcAXqE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2enh.jpg","description":"God of War Collection brings the nonstop action of God of War and God of War II to the PlayStation Vita system for the first time ever. In God of War Collection, experience the brutal world of ancient Greece as the legendary Spartan Kratos seeks revenge on Ares, the God of War, and tries to accomplish what no mortal has ever done: alter the course of Fate itself.","story":"The story is told mostly in flashback, after being framed with a scene from the present wherein Kratos, standing atop the tallest cliff in Greece, laments how the gods have abandoned him and then proceeds to toss himself into the waters below. \nWhile the player starts the game three weeks prior to this event, Kratos' background is told by the Narrator during the game (revealed to be the Titan Gaia in God of War II). Kratos was a fearsome Spartan warrior and grew his fifty-man squad into an army of thousands via strategy, tactics, ferocity, and conquest. However, in a battle against a barbarian horde, his army was massacred, and, in a desperate measure, Kratos offered his life and service to Ares, the God of War, in exchange for Ares defeating the Barbarians. Ares, sensing the enormous power in Kratos, accepted his offer and destroyed the Barbarians. He also granted Kratos the Blades of Chaos, curved blades forged in the pits of Hades that were attached to long chains which were fused to Kratos' arms. \n \nKratos then became Ares' servant, leading his Spartan army in conquering much of Greece. In one battle, they came across a village that worshiped Athena and put the residents to the sword, and their homes to the flame. There, Ares put Kratos into a rage driven by bloodlust, making him kill anyone standing in his way. Despite his own foreboding feelings and the warnings of the local oracle, Kratos entered the village's temple and slaughtered all within. Unfortunately, after his blood-lust cleared, he realized that his two last victims had been his own wife and daughter; Ares explained that this village had been a test of Kratos' power, severing the last of his humanity. The village Oracle cursed Kratos, binding the ashes of his dead family to his skin; this new pale coating gave rise to Kratos' new title, \"the Ghost of Sparta.\" and it made everyone in Greece fear him. Kratos renounced his service to Ares and began to wander the Earth, lamenting his deeds, while serving the other gods of Olympus for ten years.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:36 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:36 am","_id":"592ed0c5d1194d0e9511d059eb8d9e22","name":"God of War Collection","genres":[],"id":20068,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"19994","price":8.27,"name":"God of War Collection","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"God of War Collection","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"id":"sps3219","igdbId":20068,"gbId":28001,"gbGuid":"3030-28001","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}]},{"first_release_date":"03/15/2010","total_rating":91,"esrb":"M","videos":["MMUbcBbIXIA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25w7.jpg","description":"Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III is a single-player game that allows players to take on the climatic role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he scales through the intimidating heights of Mt. Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus. Utilizing a new game engine built from the ground up and state-of-the-art visual technologies, the development team behind God of War III has made standard-setting strides in giving players the realistic feel of actually being on the battlegrounds. With texture resolutions quadrupling since God of War II on PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, God of War III, in its debut on the PS3 system, will feature fluid, life-like characters, as well as dynamic lighting effects, a robust weapon system, and world-changing scenarios that will truly bring unmistakable realism to Kratos' fateful quest. Players will have a chance to join battles on a grand scale that is four times larger than its predecessor.","story":"Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue Kratos, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two quarrel with each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:36 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:36 am","_id":"72839492a9d541ffb71974af9878b156","name":"God of War III","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"id":499,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"21062","price":8.05,"name":"God of War III","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"God of War III","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"id":"sps3220","igdbId":499,"gbId":20461,"gbGuid":"3030-20461","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}]},{"first_release_date":"03/11/2013","total_rating":75,"esrb":"M","videos":["1TWl0FhCi34","owyXzeUbpZo","xjaG6qWeYms"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wen.jpg","description":"Vengeance is born in the fires of betrayal in this prequel to the best-selling God of War franchise.

The games feature the same features as their original releases. In addition to the games, the collection features bonus content, including extra missions, and additional character costumes, power ups and weapon styles.","story":"inFAMOUS: \ninFAMOUS is set in Empire City, a fictional metropolis based on New York City, consisting of the Neon District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, the location of the city government. Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse. \n \nCharacters \nThe protagonist is Cole MacGrath (Jason Cottle), a courier who is accused of triggering the explosion, which leaves him with the ability to absorb and project electricity. His closest friend, Zeke Jedediah Dunbar (Caleb Moody), allows Cole to hide on his rooftop, despite his envy of the former's powers. Trish Dailey (October Moore), Cole's girlfriend, abandons him out of anger over the death of her sister Amy, while most of Empire City's residents view him as a terrorist. While attempting to escape the city with Zeke, Cole is contacted by FBI agent Moya Jones (Kimberli Colbourne), who offers to clear his name if he helps her find her husband, fellow agent John White (Phil LaMarr). White vanished while investigating a group known as the First Sons, who are believed to be responsible for orchestrating the explosion. \n \nWhile working to restore order in the Neon District, Cole encounters Sasha (Jessica Straus), a former member of the First Sons, who like Cole is a \"Conduit\", an individual given powers by the First Sons. Using her ability to control the minds of others via a tar-like substance, she has formed a gang known as the Reapers. Meanwhile, the Warren has been overrun by the Dust Men, an army of homeless militants led by Alden Tate (also Jason Cottle), the original leader of the First Sons, who possesses telekinesis. Kessler (Sam A. Mowry), the true antagonist of the game, is a shadowy figure who controls the First Sons and who takes an obsessive interest in Cole and his powers. \n \nStory \nWhile the basic story of InFamous remains unchanged whether the player opts for the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" karma path, there are some story elements that change depending on Cole's choices. \n \nWhile making a delivery in the Historic District, Cole is instructed to open the package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling six city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after he is accused of triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler. \n \nWith Alden on a murderous rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him once and for all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no connection to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex. \n \n \ninFAMOUS 2: \nIn inFAMOUS 2, people with superhuman abilities, called Conduits, exist. Since the creation of the first Conduit, Cole MacGrath, the emergence of others has unsettled human society. At the same time, Cole has learned from his future self, Kessler, that a powerful Conduit known as the \"Beast\" will rise to destroy the world and that only he has the power to defeat him. \n \nStory \nFollowing the events of InFAMOUS, Cole (Eric Ladin) and his friend Zeke (Caleb Moody) meet with NSA agent Lucy Kuo (Dawn Olivieri), who informs them that Dr. Sebastian Wolfe (Michael Ensign), the man responsible for creating the Ray Sphere that gave Cole his powers, has developed an even stronger version that would give him enough strength to stop the Beast. Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed. \n \nArriving in New Marais, Cole and his allies learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city. Aware of Wolfe's intentions, Bertrand has his private army, the Militia, destroy the doctor's lab. Rescuing Wolfe, Cole learns that he has developed the Ray Field Inhibitor, a device capable of stripping Conduits of their powers. Before he can help Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a Conduit with the ability to manipulate and ignite a black, napalm-like substance, who has been waging war on the Militia. Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be a Conduit, has been forced to transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand. The two free her, but also end up releasing the mentally unstable mercenaries into the city. \n \n \ninFAMOUS 2: Festival of Blood: \nZeke Dunbar meets a woman at a bar and talks with her, when she notices a comic book Zeke was reading. The woman is about to leave until Zeke mentions his relationship with Cole MacGrath, persuading the woman to stay and listen as he begins to tell her a story involving Cole during the events of \"Pyre Night\", a fictional celebration in New Marais. \n \nDuring the event, Cole investigates a nearby church after hearing screams, rescuing civilians trapped in its crumbling catacombs. As Cole ventures deeper looking for more survivors, he encounters a woman yelling, who is revealed to be a vampire. Cole is then cuffed and dragged to a tomb deep within the church, and awakens on top of the corpse of a vampire known as Bloody Mary. One of the vampires opens up a vein from Cole's neck and drips his blood onto Mary's corpse, awakening her due to its superhuman properties. She then proceeds to bite Cole, drinking his blood and turning him into a vampire, while her youth and powers are restored from Cole's Conduit blood. \n \nWhen Cole comes to, he realizes his amp is missing, forcing him to create a makeshift wooden stake in order to fight his way out. Having escaped, he realizes, to his horror, that Mary can now invade his mind. She taunts Cole telepathically, saying that by dawn, he will complete his transformation and become her puppet forever. Driven by the need to drink blood, he feeds on a random civilian. At the same time, Mary's followers surface and begin rounding up other civilians, taking advantage of Pyre Night to blend in. Seeking a solution, Cole contacts Zeke and both begin researching Pyre Night, the celebration commemorating the burning of Bloody Mary by town hero Father Ignatius centuries ago. They eventually find out the folklore surrounding Father Ignatius, including a weapon he crafted to kill vampires, the Barbed Cross.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:39 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:39 am","_id":"5f5e7731fff14767932a03dff009f460","name":"Infamous Collection","genres":["Adventure"],"id":23828,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"33003","price":11.93,"name":"Infamous Collection","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"11/10/2006","total_rating":78,"esrb":"M","videos":["nJ8Yuq8qpbM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2b4m.jpg","description":"In an alternate 1951, Sgt.

Using advanced technology, they infect hundreds of innocent civilians and subject them to artificial evolution, creating a diverse army of creatures ranging from simple foot soldiers to spider-like giants. By 1949, all of Europe has fallen to the Chimera. The following year, a vast invasion force tunnels under the English Channel, conquering much of England and leaving only scattered pockets of human resistance. \n \nIn 1951, the United States, despite taking a position of neutrality in the conflict, sends a task force to assist the UK as part of \"Operation Deliverance\". Among the soldiers is Army Ranger Sgt. Nathan Hale. However, soon after landing in York, he and his squad are ambushed by enemy troops, who infect them with the Chimera virus. Hale, the only survivor, discovers that he has an innate resistance to full infection. Instead, he gains increased strength and reflexes, the ability to instantly heal light injuries, and gold-colored irises, a common trait of the Chimera.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:40 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:40 am","_id":"fe5782ade39e432e874dcaa4f90a1579","name":"Resistance: Fall of Man","genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"id":1278,"manual":true,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"bluray","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 3","id":"10828","price":7.82,"name":"Resistance Fall of Man","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 launch title","Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"sps3520","name":"Resistance: Fall of Man","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 launch title","Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive","Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits"],"igdbId":1278,"gbId":9741,"gbGuid":"3030-9741","tgdbId":97,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}}]}]},{"first_release_date":"11/03/2008","esrb":"M","videos":["kcekCPKNf8A"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2eoj.jpg","description":"It's 1953.

The Play component involves players taking control of Sackboy and navigating him through various levels. In the first two instalments of the series, gameplay consisted primarily of traditional platforming like jumping and avoiding obstacles to successfully navigate to the end of a level to win. Since LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a \"platform for games\" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various \"prize bubbles\" along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.","story":"LittleBigPlanet is set in a world full of creations made by Creator Curators. One of the Curators, a rogue Creator called \"the Collector\", is stealing the other Creators' creations and not sharing them with the world (sharing is one of the core elements of LittleBigPlanet). Play starts at the \"Gardens\" level, where the player meets the King, one of the Curators; the Queen; Little Xim; Big Zam and Dumpty. The player is taught the basic gameplay at this stage: running, jumping, and grabbing. The next setting is the \"Savannah\", where the player accidentally breaks one of the ruler's creations. In return for forgiveness the player must investigate what's scaring the ruler's buffalo. Further adventures involve finding Meerkat Mum's son and a Bridegroom (a story arc with a Day of the Dead theme). After the wedding play moves to the \"Canyons\", where the player must rescue Uncle Jalapeño and defeat the evil Sheriff Zapata. After completing this the player is taken to the \"Metropolis\" and gets a car for a race scenario. The next adventure takes place on the \"Islands\", where the player is trained in martial arts and must defeat the Terrible Oni. From there the player goes to the \"Temples\", to get a flame-throwing cat. Here they meet the Great Magician, who tells them to defeat the Collector in his \"Wilderness\". After the final battle the Collector is revealed to be a little, lonely man who kidnapped everyone because he did not have any friends. Everyone, including the player, offers to be his friend and he accepts, ending his being evil.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:53 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:53 am","_id":"38b8b99703264f108d04c62ec3a18223","name":"LittleBigPlanet","genres":["Platform"],"id":1058,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"LittleBigPlanet","details":["Sony PlayStation 3 full exclusive"],"id":"sps3336","igdbId":1058,"gbId":20602,"gbGuid":"3030-20602","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 3","id":"ccl22","igdbId":9,"gbId":35,"gbGuid":"3045-35","tgdbId":12}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}]},{"first_release_date":"10/03/2011","total_rating":81,"esrb":"","videos":["z_UfANCM05Y"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25kt.jpg","description":"An enhanced downloadable version of the 2010 installment of the long-running NBA Jam series of arcade basketball games, updating the player roster while adding new gameplay mechanics, a new campaign, and new secrets.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PlayStation 3","consoleId":9,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 06:54 am","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 06:54 am","_id":"b2a69e2fa8b64bc4aa9aafbe520d4a3b","name":"NBA Jam: On Fire edition","genres":["Sport","Basketball"],"id":21076,"manual":false,"location":"downstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"1","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"4","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Sport, Basketball","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","purchaseDate":"","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"10/08/2008","esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kjhld5jbv7thvginihfv.jpg","description":"The Price is Right video game is based on the longest running game show in television history.

Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).","story":"Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23] \n \nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:36 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:36 am","_id":"0e514c17404949699182acc2a3ee0cf9","name":"God of War","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"God of War","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"id":"ps2263","igdbId":549,"gbId":6959,"gbGuid":"3030-6959","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Strategy","Adventure"],"id":549,"manual":true,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Strategy, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5273","price":13.41,"name":"God of War","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/25/2004","total_rating":92,"esrb":"M","videos":["vdlpWZpwOq0","XuUc08d7hyU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tgw.jpg","description":"Returning after his mother's murder to the semi-fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), Carl Johnson, a former gang banger, must take back the streets for his family and friends by gaining respect and once again gaining control over the streets.

It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.  The game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Auditory"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","_id":"bdb83b0c8f5742a59793822c99182725","name":"Guitar Hero","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Guitar Hero","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive","Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"id":"ps2281","igdbId":1285,"gbId":6311,"gbGuid":"3030-6311","tgdbId":7189,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isLaunchTitle":false},{"name":"Guitar Hero","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps2202","igdbId":1285,"gbId":6311,"gbGuid":"3030-6311","tgdbId":7189,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Music"],"id":1285,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Music","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5296","price":6.27,"name":"Guitar Hero","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"10/27/2007","total_rating":83,"esrb":"T","videos":["WlvMkvTLO8Y"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wqm.jpg","description":"Rock out to the third entry in in Red Octane's music series for guitar gods!

It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe, and in August 2007 in Australia.  Players use a guitar-shaped controller (purchased separately) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player. Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period.  The game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.[6]","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:39 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:39 am","_id":"0549f43dd4004137b7ca65b3d26096d8","name":"Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80's","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"id":"ps2283","igdbId":2676,"gbId":12241,"gbGuid":"3030-12241","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Music","Simulator"],"id":2676,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":"-1","offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":"2","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Music, Simulator","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5297","price":5.98,"name":"Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80's","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/17/2001","esrb":"E","videos":["BVj1VZV8WU4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wfbvajeds5cvbkmngb1d.jpg","description":"Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff is a 2001 video game released on the PlayStation 2.

When activated, the Rift opens a portal, and a large ominous atmosphere and a monster appear. Jak launches the Rider through the gate, past the monster. Jak and Daxter, separated from Keira and Samos, arrive in the segregated dystopia known as Haven City. They are separated on arrival, and Jak is captured by the city's Krimzon Guard. While Jak is imprisoned, he undergoes experiments with Dark Eco under the command of the city's leader: Baron Praxis. Jak, along with previous prisoners in the city jail, were experimented on for Operation: Dark Warrior, a project that consisted of injecting prisoners with dark eco in order to give them super-human abilities to be used in Haven City's war against animalistic creatures called Metal Heads. Jak, the only prisoner to survive the experiments, is altered mentally and physically, turning him (temporarily under random and controlled spasms) into a deadly monster.","story":"Like Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, the game's begins with a speech by Samos Hagai. Jak, Daxter, Samos and Keira are in the process of activating the rift rider, the precursor device hidden behind the large door at the end of Precursor Legacy, and its accompanying rift gate. When the gate is activated a large figure steps out, accompanied by a swarm of creatures. Jak panics and activates the rift rider, propelling the group through the gate. As they are travelling through the rift, the rider is destroyed. The group fall out of the rift and are separated, though all find themselves in Haven City. Jak and Daxter land and are immediately identified by a patrol of the Krimzon Guard, led by Captain Erol. Jak is taken into custody, as Daxter promises to rescue him (see the events of Daxter). Two years later, Jak is in the Fortress, where he has been the subject of a super soldier program. His body has been infused with dark eco. Erol and the Baron Praxis are there. They declare the 'Dark Warrior Program' a failure. They leave, just as Daxter appears to rescue Jak. As Daxter fidgets with the restraints, Jak transforms into the Dark Warrior Program's ultimate goal, Dark Jak. He breaks the binds and then returns to normal, after speaking his first words, \"I'm going to kill Praxis!\" The pair then escape the fortress into Haven City.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"garage sale","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:43 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:43 am","_id":"7f9d7a8c963d47fb9b83de0058fb5af3","name":"Jak II","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Jak II","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"id":"ps2325","igdbId":1529,"gbId":10384,"gbGuid":"3030-10384","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform","Adventure"],"id":1529,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5357","price":6.77,"name":"Jak II","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"09/16/2007","total_rating":65,"esrb":"","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ow2.jpg","description":"Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights is a racing video game for various platforms.

As his guilt and trauma build, Payne finds himself in more and more impossibly unfavourable and astounding situations, which challenge his methods, his worldview, and even his existence.","story":"In December 2001, as New York City is enduring the tail end of the worst snow blizzard in the history of the city, Max Payne, a renegade DEA agent and former NYPD detective, is standing at the top of a skyscraper with a sniper rifle in his hands, smiling, as police units arrive on the scene to arrest him. He then experiences flashbacks from three years ago and the last two days he experienced. Three years earlier, on August 22nd 1998, Max was working as a regular NYPD detective, having just finished his day's work. His longtime friend and DEA agent, Alex Balder, invites him to transfer into the DEA, but Max declines the offer, wanting to focus on his full-time life with his wife, Michelle, and their newborn daughter, Rose. As he returns to his house in New Jersey, he finds that a trio of junkies had broken into his house, all addicted on a brand new designer drug, Valkyr. Max receives a call from a mysterious woman who seems pleased at the trouble in the house and refuses to call for help. Max rushes to aid his family and kill the junkies, but is too late as he finds his wife shot dead, and his daughter slaughtered. After his family's funeral, Payne accepts Alex's offer, and transfers to the DEA at his own request to stop the spreading of the drugs.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:45 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:45 am","_id":"d2c5baa792f048039ab2a431b7f560e6","name":"Max Payne","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Max Payne","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits"],"id":"ps2381","igdbId":18,"gbId":2414,"gbGuid":"3030-2414","tgdbId":null,"special":[{"value":"Sony PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits","forPlatform":{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":18,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Playstation 2","id":"5441","price":6.86,"name":"Max Payne","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"06/26/2006","total_rating":61,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2de0.jpg","description":"Mixing miniature mayhem with maximum multiplayer racing, Micro Machines v4 features knockabout, breakneck racing in the fastest scale miniatures, complete with explosive weapon power-ups.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each \"movie\" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.  New technology dubbed \"the AI Director\" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.  Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:31 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:31 am","_id":"087d51ad0177459c82a4ced2a91c11bd","name":"Left 4 Dead","extraData":["banned in Germany: Banned because of high-impact gory violence.

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"—twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned. \n \nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19] \n \nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21] \n \nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Brontë's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4] \n \nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23] \n \nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:32 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:32 am","_id":"4193a9b1a0cc489990ece2fbf6605cf5","name":"Portal","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Puzzle","FPS"],"id":71,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Puzzle, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"04/18/2011","total_rating":92,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["mC_u9ZwlIUc","9r0rlRqpkOw","Qgl1otNanh0","SQb-e7p0KmQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rs4.jpg","description":"Sequel to the acclaimed Portal (2007), Portal 2 pits the protagonist of the original game, Chell, and her new robot friend, Wheatley, against more puzzles conceived by GLaDOS, an A.I. with the sole purpose of testing the Portal Gun's mechanics and taking revenge on Chell for the events of Portal.

Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken Silverman's Build engine and improved on 3D Realms' previous Build engine game, Duke Nukem 3D. Mark Adams ported Shadow Warrior to Mac OS in August 1997.[1]  The game's improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although ultra-violent, the game emphasized tongue-in-cheek humor and contained some sexual themes (although less blatantly than in Duke Nukem 3D). A combination of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior was published by GT Interactive in March 1998, titled East Meets West.[2]","story":"Lo Wang is a bodyguard for Zilla Enterprises, which has control over every major industry in Japan.

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. \n \nGeralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad. \n \nArriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages. \n \nAfter sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship. \n \nThe pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir. \n \nCiri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. \n \nThe ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org, only main game]","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:49 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:49 am","_id":"71c292ecaf06406db2c4d8df51b28024","name":"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year Edition","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":22439,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"06/22/2001","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","videos":["0koY8weGmBI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1te4.jpg","description":"Sonic Adventure 2 is a 2001 platform video game developed by Sonic Team USA and published by Sega.

After defeating the demon invasion of the Mars moon bases and returning from Hell (the manifestation of Hell where the Deimos moon floats over), Doomguy finds that Earth has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.[10][11] \n \nThe humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Once the ships are ready, the survivors prepare to evacuate Earth. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport gets taken over by the demons, who place a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.[10] The marine then battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors escape Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.[12] \n \nJust as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved mankind, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side.

He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth has been sealed.

After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. \nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. \nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. \nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. \nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:23 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:23 am","_id":"304d40e5da9c48cda42bfad3f8a4a969","name":"Half-Life 2","genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":233,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"10/08/2007","total_rating":79,"esrb":"M","videos":["n0l5N6Exjz0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tns.jpg","description":"The second episodic sequel to one of the most influential first-person shooters of its time, Half-Life 2.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:24 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:24 am","_id":"6033daab990a4ca7963c62cd75f6f73d","name":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","FPS"],"id":247,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Puzzle, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"10/08/2007","total_rating":79,"esrb":"M","videos":["n0l5N6Exjz0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tns.jpg","description":"The second episodic sequel to one of the most influential first-person shooters of its time, Half-Life 2.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:24 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:24 am","_id":"9fcf6e22e38d4f939da664605b4ab580","name":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two","genres":["Shooter","Puzzle","FPS"],"id":247,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Puzzle, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"10/26/2005","total_rating":67,"videos":["ebWcZbIYuN4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25r5.jpg","description":"Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:25 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:25 am","_id":"0aef9171b5ad4eb8978eb92eaee63411","name":"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast","genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":10395,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"04/30/2006","total_rating":64,"esrb":"M","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qrf.jpg","description":"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a recreation of the first multiplayer game set in the Half-Life universe.

The game was developed by Gearbox Software with Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on June 12, 2001. (It was originally set for release in Spring.) Blue Shift is the second expansion for Half-Life, originally intended as part of a Dreamcast version of the original game. Although the Dreamcast port was later cancelled, the PC version continued development and was released as a standalone product. The game was released on Steam on August 24, 2005.","story":"Blue Shift begins in a similar manner to Half-Life, as Barney Calhoun rides a train through the Black Mesa facility to reach his place of work. After reporting for duty, Calhoun is instructed to assist in maintenance on a malfunctioning elevator. As Calhoun finishes repairs, however, Freeman's experiment takes place and results in a \"resonance cascade\", causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures into the base. The elevator is badly damaged and fails, sending Calhoun plummeting into the depths of Black Mesa. \nCalhoun regains consciousness at the bottom of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell. \nCalhoun travels to the power generators on a lower level to find a fresh power cell while firefights rage between the Marines and the forces of Xen. After returning with a new power cell, Calhoun assists Rosenberg in evacuating the few surviving personnel through the teleporter. Calhoun is the last to enter the portal and as he does so, Marines breach the laboratory and fire on him, causing the teleporter to explode.

The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility after a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units.","story":"Opposing Force opens with Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him. \n \nOther Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies. \n \nShephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path. \n \nAt the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:27 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:27 am","_id":"65c09a0e378d4170a8d5de9c9067cb4b","name":"Half-Life: Opposing Force","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Puzzle","FPS"],"id":232,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Puzzle, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"03/30/1996","total_rating":80,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1q0v.jpg","description":"In a twisted medieval dimension, undead creatures and bestial horrors have done the unthinkable--callously slaughtering your entire race.

Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.","story":"The opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters as they ride a train on Pandora. However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. \nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. \nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. \nJack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. \nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. \nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen fades to black.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":4,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:01 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:01 am","_id":"12e817ba15be4eacbc81d53aa9d76d79","name":"Borderlands 2","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","FPS"],"id":1011,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"10/23/2002","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/om28ctubjf3a1iw9xnhp.jpg","description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:02 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:02 am","_id":"d92cee5b6c1c43c1af16ef47a4dfa1d8","name":"Sid Meier's Civilization III: Game of the Year Edition","genres":["Simulator","Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"id":53609,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Simulator, Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS)","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"first_release_date":"05/15/2011","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":["w7uOhFTrrq0","E0scnF8pXfU","cV3Cfed4RBU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rbo.jpg","description":"Dig, fight, explore, build!

The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release.  Crash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the sixth game in the main franchise, but it is the first in the Mutant series. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.  The game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:13 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:13 pm","_id":"d7b70a07b2444024be2a5253bc008f9e","name":"Crash of the Titans","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":1190,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":false,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Wii","id":"8773","price":10.1,"name":"Crash of the Titans","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"11/24/2010","total_rating":76,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1vxk.jpg","description":"Disney Epic Mickey is an action-adventure platforming game for Wii console that sends Mickey Mouse on an epic journey of creativity and discovery.

Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link's Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.  Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.  Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.  Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.  Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.  Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.  The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Fair","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","_id":"256dd29f6bff442a829e4c71de2f22c0","name":"Link's Crossbow Training","extraData":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","details":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"id":"wii169","igdbId":4973,"gbId":1074,"gbGuid":"3030-1074","tgdbId":2248,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii","id":"ccl5","igdbId":5,"gbId":36,"gbGuid":"3045-36","tgdbId":9}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},{"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","details":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"id":"wii166","igdbId":4973,"gbId":1074,"gbGuid":"3030-1074","tgdbId":2248,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii","id":"ccl5","igdbId":5,"gbId":36,"gbGuid":"3045-36","tgdbId":9}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":4973,"manual":false,"location":"both","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":1,"offlinecoopmax":1,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":1,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"dvd","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Wii","id":"32418","price":4.42,"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"04/09/2008","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","videos":["MKHLzFGA8o8","A5w_WTw112M"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co214e.jpg","description":"Mario Kart Wii is a multiplayer-oriented racing game for the Wii, and the sixth main installment in the Mario Kart series.

Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers.

It is considered the spiritual successor to Rare's earlier first-person shooter GoldenEye 007, with which it shares many gameplay features. Perfect Dark was first released in North America on 22 May 2000; PAL and NTSC-J releases followed soon afterwards. A separate Game Boy Color game, also titled Perfect Dark, was released in August 2000 as a supplement to the game and allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via a Transfer Pak.\n\nThe game features a single-player mode consisting of 17 main missions in which the player assumes the role of Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings. Technically, it is one of the most advanced games developed for the Nintendo 64, with an optional high resolution graphics mode and Dolby Surround Sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features.","story":"","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"retro store in WF","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 07:52 am","updatedAt":"11/09/2021 06:11 am","_id":"d7c46f7defb349ac88b57049acb9a5af","name":"Perfect Dark","extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive","Nintendo 64 Player's Choice"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Perfect Dark","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive","Nintendo 64 Player's Choice"],"id":"n64106","igdbId":1463,"gbId":21256,"gbGuid":"3030-21256","tgdbId":173,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"special":[{"value":"Nintendo 64 Player's Choice","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}}],"isLaunchTitle":false},{"name":"Perfect Dark","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n6497","igdbId":1463,"gbId":21256,"gbGuid":"3030-21256","tgdbId":173,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":1463,"manual":false,"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"genresDisplay":"Shooter, FPS","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","purchaseDate":"","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","id":"3865","price":19.88,"name":"Perfect Dark","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"first_release_date":"12/11/1998","total_rating":46,"esrb":"M","videos":["YtWnexGHIng","ujXJmc005cs","8aquXZISjus","c-qD6vvjYVc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2chc.jpg","description":"Single player takes the form of a \"Story\" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps. The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.","story":"A mysterious comet is approaching the earth; described by the opening narration as a force of concentrated evil that no force of good can stand against.

The flight recorder is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson corporation, in orbit around the KG-348 gas giant. Samuels offers Ripley a place on the Weyland-Yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the Torrens courier ship. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. They attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. \n \nWhile exploring Sevastopol, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo with no data and learns that the station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station's Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, whose crew discovered the flight recorder near the LV-426 moon, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the derelict, Marlow's wife was attacked by a facehugger. She was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien inside a remote module of the station. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens towards KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit. \n \nRipley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station's service androids abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. Samuels attempts to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, the systems's defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. There, Ripley discovers that Seegson had been trying to sell off Sevastopol to Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien at all costs. Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, but the system refuses, stating that \"scheduled reactor scans are unverified\". At the reactor, Ripley discovers an alien nest and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent to retrieve the alien and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crossed her and took her hostage aboard the Anesidora. \n \nAboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers a message from her mother that was recorded after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving Ripley closure. Marlow attempts to overload the fusion reactor of the Anesidora to destroy the station and ensure that no remaining alien creatures survive; Taylor kills him in attempt to reverse the process, but she herself is killed by the electric discharge, forcing Ripley to escape shortly before the Anesidora explodes. The explosion destroys Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger latches on to Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. When Ripley is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2020-12-22","howAcquired":"Epic Games","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"free on countdown to Christmas free stuff from Epic","createdAt":"12/24/2020 08:10 am","updatedAt":"12/24/2020 08:10 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1vzu.jpg","description":"Discover the true meaning of fear in Alien: Isolation, a survival horror set in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger.

The player explores dungeons with a four-hero team. While players can only explore with four heroes, they will be able to recruit and manage around a dozen heroes from the local tavern or caravan. The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. \n \nCombat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. \n \nInstead of leveling, heroes have \"resolve\" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. \n \nWhile exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2020-12-25T06:00:00.000Z","_id":"568aa71d6f514bcc8c3f53937f4ef486","genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS), Indie","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"name":"Forts","id":34269,"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"total_rating":60,"first_release_date":"04/18/2017","esrb":"","videos":[],"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"story":"","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":"7.50","physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2020-12-26","howAcquired":"Steam","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"on sale 50% off","createdAt":"12/27/2020 06:45 am","updatedAt":"12/27/2020 06:45 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mkj.jpg","description":"Forts is a physics-based RTS where foes design and build custom bases, arm them to the teeth and blast their opponent's creations to rubble.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2020-12-26T06:00:00.000Z","_id":"ae4f032ae1194b0a91f890ea57accd40","genresDisplay":"Real Time Strategy (RTS), Strategy","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"name":"Control","id":103329,"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"total_rating":84,"first_release_date":"08/26/2019","esrb":"M","videos":["8Idtqyx6gsU","BnQwE0ug_Q0","9QkLwj66bM0","vWSfCxKgTIM","tcH6CjMjAcg","e2C1FBVrW4w"],"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"story":"After a secretive agency in New York is invaded by an otherworldly threat, you become the new Director struggling to regain Control. \n \nControl is Jesse Faden’s story and her personal search for answers as she grows into the role of the Director.

Among them is the player's unnamed character, a rookie undertaking their first mission. Accompanying them is Faye, Haluk's own wife and Cypher. Shortly into the mission, all the other Freelancers are killed, prompting Faye to call a retreat, with the player evacuating a wounded Haluk. The resounding failure causes people to lose faith in the Freelancers, whose ranks are now decimated. \n \nTwo years later, the player has settled in Fort Tarsis, a frontier city between The Heart of Rage and Antium, Bastion’s capital. Partnered with a young Cypher named Owen, they make a living completing modest Freelancer contracts for the locals. Owen aspires to be a Freelancer, despite his psychic abilities being a hindrance to piloting a Javelin. \n \nAn agent of Corvus named Tassyn hires the player to locate a spy who went missing while undercover with a smuggling gang called the Regulators. At a devastated Regulator hideout, they encounter a Dominion leader called The Monitor. The Monitor is a powerful Cypher, a skilled Javelin pilot, and participated in the assault on Freemark that created the Heart of Rage. The Monitor executes Tassyn's spy and takes a Shaper relic that they were hiding. Tassyn surmises that The Dominion is collecting relics for another attempt to reach the Cenotaph, and rehires the player to reach the Cenotaph first. She also notes that Haluk and Faye have spent the past two years developing a new plan to deactivate the Cenotaph, recruiting the pair to Tassyn's mission. \n \nFaye and Haluk believe that the only Javelin able to survive the Heart of Rage is General Tarsis’s legendary Javelin of Dawn. Using clues found in the tombs of Tarsis’s Legionnaires, they locate Tarsis’s secret tomb. Within her tomb, the player's obtains Taris's signet, which acts as a key to the Fortress of Dawn- the site of Tarsis's last stand and the Javelin of Dawn's resting place. At the Temple of Dawn, the player is challenged by trials of skill and resolve. After reenacting Tarsis’s last stand, an apparition of General Tarsis declares the player to possess the qualities of a Legionnaire of Dawn and grants access to her Javelin. Before the player can take possession of the Javelin of Dawn, their own Javelin freezes up. Owen appears and takes credit for sabotaging their Javelin so he can take the Javelin of Dawn for himself. He plans to accept The Monitor's offer to spare Fort Tarsis in exchange for assisting him with the Javelin of Dawn, and accuses the player of keeping him from his dream to be a Freelancer. Before Owen leaves in the Javelin of Dawn, Faye scans its unique shielding module, the Shield of Dawn, hoping that it can be duplicated so the player can enter the Heart of Rage with their own Javelin. \n \nHaluk and Faye succeed in building a copy of the Shield of Dawn, but are unable to activate it. At the same time, Tassyn arrives to announce that The Dominion are nearing the Heart of Rage. Tassyn also reveals that she hired the player at Faye's own request in order to replace Haluk's role as a Javelin pilot. Upset, Haluk flies his Javelin to the Fortress of Dawn to find a way to activate the Shield of Dawn, but is ambushed by The Dominion. The player arrives to find that Haluk was saved by Owen, who apologizes for his betrayal. As a peace offering, Owen gives up his own Shield of Dawn before leaving. \n \nAfter activating the Shield of Dawn on their Javelin, the player returns to the Heart of Rage, with Faye and Haluk providing remote support. The player discovers that The Monitor has used the conduit to merge with the Anthem, and is forced to fight him. After The Monitor dies, Faye uses her powers to deactivate the Cenotaph and close the Heart of Rage. \n \nWhile celebrating in Fort Tarsis, the player is pulled away by Tassyn to see the corpse of a Urgoth recently discovered and killed inside of Bastion's borders. Suspecting another crisis, the player is asked to be ready to help again.","consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":"8","physical":true,"cib":true,"maxMultiplayer":0,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-01-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"sealed","createdAt":"01/10/2021 08:53 am","updatedAt":"01/10/2021 08:53 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2n94.jpg","description":"Anthem is a shared-world action RPG, where players can delve into a vast landscape teeming with amazing technology and forgotten treasures.

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization. \n \nFitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items. \n \nThe Surge features innovative combat mechanics, allowing you to target individual limbs and dismember the exo-suit add-on or weapon you want to acquire. Collecting tech-scrap and blueprints, you will be able to return to the Operation Center to level up and craft new exo-suit addons and weapons salvaged throughout the level. The most powerful of these can be acquired from the world’s gigantic, industrial bosses. Most of what you encounter in The Surge was never originally designed to kill you, and most of the items you loot and craft were never meant for combat. However, the combined strength of the exo-suit and near-future technology of CREO mean that anything from fork-lifting addons to laser cutters can be used as lethal weapons for diving deeper into the facility.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-01-15T06:00:00.000Z","_id":"9d814c3160d24b18a9adee19cb8fa3c9","genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"name":"Lords of the Fallen","id":4847,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"total_rating":68,"first_release_date":"10/27/2014","esrb":"M","videos":["SsSKj9pnh1o","dcWx_yT_ZuA","x7DOCA1i9Cg","FO3wCucDmNU"],"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"story":"","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":"3","physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-01-15","howAcquired":"GOG","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"","createdAt":"01/18/2021 07:11 am","updatedAt":"01/18/2021 07:11 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1nzt.jpg","description":"Lords of the Fallen is a challenging fantasy action RPG set in a harsh world where humanity has defeated its God.

These elves had a major problem, though. Their prized mushroom garden was infested with pests--a giant Centipede, a poison-spreading scorpion, a mischief-making spider, and a pesky flea. The good elves tried everything they could to rid their garden of these bugs. But nothing worked. \n \n \nOne day, an elf named Oliver was hacking away at a poisoned mushroom in the garden. Suddenly, he saw an unusual stick gleaming in the dirt. Just as Oliver picked up the stick, a spider jumped out from behind a mushroom and rushed at him. When Oliver waved his hands wildly to try to scare the spider away, sparks flew from his stick and the spider disappeared! \n \n \n\"How did that happen?\" Oliver wondered out loud. \"Could this be a magic wand?\" \n \n \nSoon Oliver had another chance to try the wand. When the scorpion scurried across a row of mushroom, poisoning every mushroom it touched, Oliver pointed the wand at the scorpion and shouted, \"Be gone!\" Instantly, the scorpion disappeared and the poisoned mushrooms were transformed back into normal mushrooms. \n \n \n\"This is great! This is the tool we need to clean up our mushroom garden\" Oliver shouted ecstatically. \n \n \nWith his new found magic wand, Oliver hid behind a mushroom. \"OK, you great big Centipede,\" he said. \"Come out wherever you are.

His weapon of choice is his shotgun. He is assisted by another man called Chumbucket. Chum mainly works with Max to build and upgrade the Magnum Opus vehicle. \n \nMad Max will feature a variety of weapons which Max can use to defeat enemies. Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. \n \nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented. \n \nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-03-19T05:00:00.000Z","_id":"c6dfc282a5ae4e4996bd4a550e4573a9","genresDisplay":"Shooter, Racing, Adventure","purchaseDate":"03/19/2021","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"none"},{"name":"Max Payne","id":18,"genres":["Shooter"],"total_rating":80,"first_release_date":"07/22/2001","esrb":"M","videos":["NHMEE4LxYms"],"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"story":"In December 2001, as New York City is enduring the tail end of the worst snow blizzard in the history of the city, Max Payne, a renegade DEA agent and former NYPD detective, is standing at the top of a skyscraper with a sniper rifle in his hands, smiling, as police units arrive on the scene to arrest him.

The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; each player is differentiated by color. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\". \n \nIn addition to the new \"class\" system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy. \n \nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits. \n \nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power). \n \nThis sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":["NES Four Score compatible title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Gauntlet II","id":"nes156","details":["NES Four Score compatible title"],"igdbId":3503,"gbId":648,"gbGuid":"3030-648","special":[{"value":"NES Four Score compatible title","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","id":"ccl1","igdbId":18,"gbId":21,"gbGuid":"3045-21","tgdbId":7}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"newDatePurchased":"2021-06-11T05:00:00.000Z","_id":"9917dcb1ba2e49abbc8840e978c962a3","genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure, Arcade","purchaseDate":"06/11/2021","vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"caseType":"ugc","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"NES","id":"9013","price":10.72,"name":"Gauntlet II","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"name":"Arkanoid","id":4595,"genres":["Arcade"],"total_rating":82,"first_release_date":"11/30/1986","esrb":"","videos":["-mumMl5RBes"],"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"story":"The player controls the \"Vaus\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \"paddle\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks.

There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. \n \nAt round 33, the final stage, the player will take on the game's boss, \"DOH\", a head resembling moai.

In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.\n\nThe penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.\n\nAs in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","manual":true,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-07-24T05:00:00.000Z","_id":"c1d16ab7dbdb476882906fac073f3c57","caseType":"cd","genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Adventure, Arcade","purchaseDate":"07/24/2021","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16","id":"14519","price":36.72,"name":"Pac-Land","case":"cib","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"name":"Military Madness","id":44334,"genres":["Strategy","Turn-based strategy (TBS)"],"total_rating":77,"first_release_date":"02/08/1989","esrb":"E","videos":[],"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"story":"","consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":0,"physical":true,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":"2","multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-07-24","howAcquired":"Classic Game Fest","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"","createdAt":"07/24/2021 09:15 pm","updatedAt":"07/24/2021 09:15 pm","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bqxe8w8urkb6dfni11jt.jpg","description":"Space on Earth has become limited, and mankind has looked to colonize the moon.

And make adrenaline California's most plentiful natural resource.\n\nWish they all could be California Games.\nGet ready to shred the face off an awesomely tubular wave. Turn a \"berm\" on a BMX bike and spray up a wall of dirt. Launch a few feet off-the-lip with your skateboard tucked high. And while you're up there, dance for the crowd. Or if you're feeling like kicking back a bit, float a flying disk, juggle a foot bag with your heels, or just slalom the boardwalk on skates.\n\nWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\nBut this ain't beach blanket bingo. In fact, before you even set foot on California turf, you'll choose an on-screen sponsor from among the heaviest names on the circuit. Then, hit the competition route. Prizes include trophies for a single event and a top prize in overall competition.\n\nSo get air. Go crazy. Welcome to a new state of intensity.\n\nCalifornia Games was the original \"Extreme Games\" – what today's generation might call \"X-Games in the sun\". Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.\n\nThe Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-07-25T05:00:00.000Z","_id":"9085786e98a846a7a42d91bf17f25494","caseType":"sega","genresDisplay":"Sport","purchaseDate":"07/25/2021","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Sega Master System","id":"18797","price":13.97,"name":"California Games","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"name":"Corpse Killer","id":5372,"genres":["Shooter"],"total_rating":null,"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","esrb":"M","videos":["EGCoWLf-klI"],"player_perspectives":["First person"],"story":"","consoleName":"Sega CD","consoleId":78,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":"50","physical":true,"cib":true,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-07-25","howAcquired":"Classic Game Fest","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"32X version","createdAt":"07/25/2021 08:07 pm","updatedAt":"07/25/2021 08:07 pm","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p4y.jpg","description":"Corpse Killer is a full-motion video shoot-'em up.

Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. \nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. \nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","manual":true,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-08-13T05:00:00.000Z","_id":"716d8c7709ed47ce818929e2b50fbbf9","genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade","purchaseDate":"08/13/2021","caseType":"ugc","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","id":"20152","price":11.49,"name":"Galaga","case":"loose","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"}},{"name":"Mario Bros.","id":3105,"genres":["Platform","Adventure","Arcade"],"total_rating":75,"first_release_date":"07/13/1983","esrb":"E","videos":["zh0_sYvBPP4"],"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"story":"The story of this game revolves around two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, who are working in the sewers of New York.

Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6.\" According to the account, Dr. No shot the agent in his right eye during a mission.\nThree years after the incident that claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test and is held directly responsible for the \"death\" of 007. Charged with \"reckless brutality,\" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.\nThe agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at Auric Enterprises, where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename \"GoldenEye\"). Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At Hong Kong, GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the OMEN with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to Crab Key (Dr. No's base) with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.\nGoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the OMEN to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus that he can use to overload the OMEN.\nGoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the OMEN are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber that he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the OMEN, causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.","consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":"5","physical":true,"cib":true,"maxMultiplayer":0,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-08-23","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"","createdAt":"08/23/2021 07:17 pm","updatedAt":"08/23/2021 07:17 pm","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dlx.jpg","description":"GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is a first-person shooter video game developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts.

The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction – It’s one thing to defeat your enemies. It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie.

The emulated games span multiple genres and consoles—from the ZX Spectrum to the Xbox 360—and retain the features and errors of their original releases with minimal edits. The compilation adds cheats to make the older games easier and a Snapshots mode of specific challenges culled from parts of the games. Player progress is rewarded with behind-the-scenes footage and interviews about Rare's major and unreleased games.\n\nThe compilation was one of several ideas Rare considered to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backwards compatibility features, and the idea to connect Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre.

In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.\n\nExplore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...\n\nBe careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you \"alive\"; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.\n\nThere will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the \"energy\" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.\n\nVampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.\n\nAs you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-12-23T06:00:00.000Z","_id":"2bb0208e5c0c4d02acd005bdd622b631"},{"name":"Pathfinder: Kingmaker","id":36929,"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Tactical"],"total_rating":76,"first_release_date":"09/24/2018","esrb":null,"videos":["oA5IQVegc6M","5mP0AxgTZEA","wRT9dSWHbrs"],"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"story":"To the north lie the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom! To do so, you’ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court.\n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo’s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don’t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love as well as a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\n\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won’t be adventuring alone. “”Kingmaker”” features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\n\nYour Kingdom\n\nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler. Most importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court.\n\nAs you’ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength.\n\nExplore – Conquer – Rule","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-12-24","howAcquired":"Epic Games","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"free; complete edition","createdAt":"12/27/2021 04:52 pm","updatedAt":"12/27/2021 04:52 pm","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29gf.jpg","description":"Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the first isometric party-based computer RPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe.

By her suggestion and against Whitman's advice, the expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated from the others and captured by a strange, savage man. She manages to escape while her captor is killed as the cave collapses due to her actions. As Lara tries to locate the other survivors, she finds more evidence that the island is inhabited, such as strange carvings, dead bodies, and animal sacrifices. She eventually finds her friend Sam and a man called Mathias, who claims to be a teacher who was shipwrecked on the island. As Sam tells Mathias the legends of Himiko, Lara passes out; when she wakes, Mathias and Sam are nowhere in sight. When Lara regroups with the other survivors, Whitman decides to go with Lara and search for the still-missing Roth, while the rest of the group (Reyes, Jonah, Alex and Grim) set out to find Sam and Mathias. As Lara and Whitman explore, they discover that the island's inhabitants are worshipping Himiko, confirming that the island is Yamatai. Upon discovering a shrine erected in Himiko's name, they are captured by the islanders and taken to a settlement along with several other survivors from the Endurance. When the survivors attempt an escape, the captors turn on them. Lara is separated from Whitman and tries to hide, but is found by one of the islanders and forced to kill him. She fights off the remainder of the attackers and reunites with Roth, saving him from a wolf attack.\n\nLara manages to activate a radio tower and call for help, but the plane that answers the call is struck by a freak storm, and Lara hears a mysterious voice saying \"No one leaves\" in Japanese. Unable to save the surviving pilots, Lara is contacted by Alex and Reyes, who reveal that Sam has been kidnapped by the islanders, a violent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood. Lara tries to rescue her, but is stopped by Mathias, leader of the Solarii, and ordered killed: she is saved by an attack from samurai-like Oni. Escaping the ancient monastery where she is taken by the Oni, she hears from Sam that Mathias is going to put her through the \"Ascension\", a \"fire ritual\" to find the next Sun Queen that will burn her to death if it is unsuccessful. Lara follows them to the Solarii fortress and is aided by Grim. The Solarii take Grim hostage, but he sacrifices himself so Lara can escape. With Roth's aid, Lara infiltrates the fortress and sees the ritual begin. When the fires are lit, a great wind blows them out, showing Sam to be the next Sun Queen. Lara escapes again and reunites with her friends, forming a plan to rescue Sam and escape. Aided by Whitman—who has managed to negotiate some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the helicopter approaches. As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for Lara. While mourning Roth, Lara accepts that the storms are not natural, but are somehow connected to the Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with the other survivors, who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided that it can be repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara and Alex find parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.\n\nFinding an account of a World War II-era Japanese military and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds the remains of a samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Lara returns to the survivors on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah and Reyes give chase, heading up a river to the monastery, with Lara arriving just in time to see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to the Oni: the Oni kill Whitman. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, knocks Mathias off the platform to his death. Symbolically, she does so using both her pistol and his in a dual-wield style that will later become one of her signatures. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam, but Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms. Lara, Sam, Reyes and Jonah then leave the island and are picked up by a cargo ship: as they sail home, Lara realizes that the mythical stories her father told her were more than stories, deciding not to return home just yet, and the screen fades to white with a proclamation of \"A Survivor is Born.\"","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":0,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-12-30","howAcquired":"Epic Games","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"free","createdAt":"12/31/2021 06:53 am","updatedAt":"12/31/2021 06:53 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rbu.jpg","description":"Tomb Raider explores the intense and gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor.

The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm—a massive storm—and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-12-30","howAcquired":"Epic Games","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"free","createdAt":"12/31/2021 06:55 am","updatedAt":"12/31/2021 06:55 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1vcn.jpg","description":"Experience Lara Croft's defining moment.\n\nAs Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nBecome the Tomb Raider","manual":false,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2021-12-30T06:00:00.000Z","_id":"52fc1d382b4647adb2465311f56b3e9f"},{"name":"Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration","id":23331,"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"total_rating":86,"first_release_date":"10/10/2016","esrb":"M","videos":["SnFXM3zo1KQ","YWrR_VhDvMc","H3dr8NrQxXs","kD0PwhcD_A4","4B9alWaq95Y"],"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Virtual Reality"],"story":"","consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2021-12-30","howAcquired":"Epic Games","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"free","createdAt":"12/31/2021 06:56 am","updatedAt":"12/31/2021 06:56 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ib1.jpg","description":"Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration includes the critically acclaimed Rise of the Tomb Raider, nominated for over 75 ‘Best Of’ awards.

Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets. \n \nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan—a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength—intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan. \n \nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment. \n \nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker—who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum.

Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and turn into a morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement is not limited to a two-dimensional plane. Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range.\n\nWhen the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches to a first-person view, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points.

Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus's body.\nFeeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship's emergency systems automatically ejected Samus' escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X.\n\nSamus Infected 2\nSamus, infected by the X Parasites.\nThe organic components of Samus's Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus's central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus's chances of survival were lower than one percent.\nMetroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus' dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids' vulnerability to cold.\n\nUpon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship's computer (whom she has named \"Adam\", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected.\n\nSA-X 1\nThe SA-X.\nAs she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus's fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility's Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388.\nAfter the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship's computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for \"peaceful applications\". The computer reveals that the station's SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab's location. Much to Samus's surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station.\n\nLater, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X's destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and \"galactic civilization will end.\"\n\nAs an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station's self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship's computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: \"Don't let them do this. Can't you see what will happen, Adam?\" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus's revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station's orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship's computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death.\n\nSamus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the \"Unnamed Suit\" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus's ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck.\n\nAs Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever.\n\nReflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: \"Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must.\" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: \"we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.\"","consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":"104.67","physical":true,"cib":false,"maxMultiplayer":1,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinecoopmax":1,"offlinemax":1,"splitscreen":false},"datePurchased":"2022-03-05","howAcquired":"GameOver","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"","createdAt":"03/06/2022 07:16 am","updatedAt":"03/06/2022 07:16 am","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3w49.jpg","description":"The famed Metroid series makes its return on the Game Boy Advance with Metroid Fusion.

But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat.

Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and turn into a morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement is not limited to a two-dimensional plane. Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range.\n\nWhen the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches to a first-person view, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.","manual":true,"compilation":false,"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false},"compilationGamesIds":[],"location":"both","handheld":false,"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"newDatePurchased":"2022-03-23T05:00:00.000Z","caseType":"dvd","priceCharting":{"consoleName":"Wii","id":"21969","price":38.21,"name":"Metroid: Other M","case":"sealed","lastUpdated":"05/04/2022"},"_id":"7cb6a7c5a7da4eee95be4765dafa9eed"},{"name":"TimeSplitters: Future Perfect","id":2144,"genres":["Shooter"],"total_rating":83,"first_release_date":"03/20/2005","esrb":"M","videos":["dGJ_ZIhhAkM","mgg_0c8QX08"],"player_perspectives":["First person"],"story":"The game begins in 2401 when the space marine, Sergeant Cortez, is leaving the space station that he destroyed at the end of TimeSplitters 2.

Dr. Eggman discovered the island, and found a mysterious little ring inscribed with text dating from a legendary civilization. Soon after, Eggman found another ancient ring resembling one of the Super Rings of the Floating Island, which turned out to be the Special Ring once used by that lost people. The mysterious space the Special Ring created was filled with the Master Emerald Pillar's energy, which crystallized into six Chaos Rings. After this phenomenon, Eggman decided to continue the investigation of the Special Ring in order to uncover the secrets of the rings used by Sonic and friends, as well as to theoretically summon the coveted Master Emerald. Inspired, Eggman quickly converted the island into a resort he dubbed Newtrogic High Zone, serving as his high-tech research fortress. He crystallized energy into artificial Dark Rings for his machines, and began to develop Ring Power, which would create a space-time connection between Rings. Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee all arrived at the island for different reasons, and ended up being captured and placed in the Combi Catcher machine by Eggman and Metal Sonic. Knuckles the Echidna, deducing that something was amplifying the power of the Master Emerald Pillar, also headed to the island and managed to rescue Espio along the way. The two then make their way to the World Entrance where they find the others, and go on to stop Dr. Eggman from succeeding in his plans.\n\nWestern\nThe plot starts out on the day before the opening day of Carnival Island, a huge amusement resort with the latest in high-tech rides and games. As the guardian of the island, Knuckles' job was to make sure nothing went wrong before the grand event.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Dr. Robotnik was cooking up a new dastardly scheme. To fuel his latest diabolical device, Robotnik went to Carnival Island to find the Power Emerald that supplied electricity to the entire island- a tool which would fit into his plan perfectly. To further ensure that Knuckles and his friends would not interfere with his plans, Robotnik used his Combi Catcher to freeze Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee in time.\n\nWhen Knuckles returned from patrolling the far end of the island, he found Dr. Robotnik as he was imprisoning Espio the Chameleon in a Combi Catcher, scaring the villain off and rescuing Espio. After that, Knuckles discovered that he could rescue his other friends one at a time by using Ring Power, a power that holds two partners together like a magical rubber band. Never held back for long, Knuckles set out with his team to save Carnival Island from Robotnik before the grand opening.","consoleName":"Sega 32X","consoleId":30,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":"223.15","physical":true,"cib":true,"maxMultiplayer":2,"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"datePurchased":"2022-04-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","physicalDigital":["physical"],"notes":"CIB","createdAt":"04/15/2022 06:06 pm","updatedAt":"04/15/2022 06:06 pm","image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yio.jpg","description":"A mysterious island rose from the sea shortly after the events of Sonic & Knuckles.
