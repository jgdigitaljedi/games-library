It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown. \n \nThe game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2.

Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. \nCrackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta.

At its core, Fuzion Frenzy is a four-player party game featuring 45 different mini-games (not including the titular Fuzion Frenzy). A demo of the game was included with some other launch titles in the US, including Halo, Munch's Oddysee, the first Project Gotham Racing game and Amped. The title was among the first to be released as a part of the Xbox Originals program. \n \nA sequel was later released for the Xbox 360, entitled Fuzion Frenzy 2.","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox launch title","Microsoft Xbox exclusive","Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass","Microsoft Xbox launch title","Microsoft Xbox exclusive","Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"xbox155","name":"Fuzion Frenzy","details":["Microsoft Xbox launch title","Microsoft Xbox exclusive","Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass"],"igdbId":5842,"gbId":16650,"gbGuid":"3030-16650","tgdbId":6070,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}],"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}],"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}},{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}]},{"id":"xbox155","name":"Fuzion Frenzy","details":["Microsoft Xbox launch title","Microsoft Xbox exclusive","Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass"],"igdbId":5842,"gbId":16650,"gbGuid":"3030-16650","tgdbId":6070,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}],"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}],"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}},{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox One - Available via Game Pass","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}]}],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11},{"consoleId":49,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox One"},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Uniracers","id":16743,"genres":["Racing"],"total_rating":77,"total_rating_count":4,"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","developers":"DMA Design","esrb":"","alternative_names":[{"id":6022,"name":"Unirally"}],"cover":{"id":13960,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yqkla7hkpflk2sybcwni.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"}],"summary":"What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater? \n \nIt might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly.

In the solo mode called \"The Subspace Emissary,\" the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called \"The Primid.\" Normally, characters come alive in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels. \n \n \nHow to progress through the game: \nFor multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters. \n \n \nCharacters: \nMario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another. \n \n \nSpecial powers/weapons/moves/features: \nAnything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.","extraData":["Nintendo Wii exclusive","Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Smash Bros.
