At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love – and hope. It’s about how even when confronted with such enormous tragedy they find a reason to live. Hope never dies.","story":"Set in the beautiful, volcanic scarred high-desert of the Pacific Northwest, Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game where you play as Deacon St. John, a Drifter and bounty hunter who would rather risk the dangers of the broken road than live in one of the “safe” wilderness encampments. The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers – mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks – Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one.

Although the player controls Fox for almost the entirety of the game, the first level of Star Fox Adventures involves playing as another fox called Krystal, who speaks another language, from a different planet called Cerinia.  Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.  Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.  Fox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.  Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.  To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.  Fox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.  In order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.  Prince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick.  As you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu.  There are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time.  The game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi.  It is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games.  When engaged with an enemy, the combat is real time, meaning each of Fox's movements in combat require the press of the A button, similar to how each sword swing in Zelda or Skyrim require the press of a button.","story":"Fox Mccloud investigates a planet on the edge of the Lylat System called Dinosaur Planet, which is falling apart.

The Worlds are populated by NPC's, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney's Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the \"Heartless\" forms the other.  Successful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes.  The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency \"Munny\", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated. Such items include those used to restore HP and MP, items to aid party members or synthesis materials which can be used to create weapons and armor.","story":"The universe of Kingdom Hearts is a collection of various levels, referred to as \"worlds\", through which the player must progress. Thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game. \n \nThe graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the world are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship. \n \nThe worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several Final Fantasy games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the Final Fantasy characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each \"Keyhole\"; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance. \n \nKingdom Hearts begins with Sora's Dive to the Heart, which foreshadows the events that will soon take place, but soon progresses to Destiny Islands, where Sora lives with his two best friends, Riku and Kairi. The three friends seek to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose. One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures. Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku first; Riku disappears into darkness, curious about what it contains. Soon after, Sora obtains a mysterious weapon, the Keyblade, to defend himself. Using it to fend off the creatures, he heads for a secret cave, where he finds Kairi near a door. She turns to him, saying his name as the door behind her blows open. The ensuing blast of darkness sends Sora and Kairi both out of the cave. The islands are soon destroyed, and Sora is left adrift, Riku and Kairi's whereabouts unknown.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"PlayStation 2: 5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game","createdAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","updatedAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","_id":"a2a761e50c5c46a0ad3955a288c9fbed","name":"Kingdom Hearts","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Kingdom Hearts","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps2243","igdbId":1219,"gbId":10983,"gbGuid":"3030-10983","tgdbId":2559,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Sport"],"id":1219,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":"5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game"}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/05/1997","esrb":"T","videos":["LmTLexOJIM4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mxausltymd3nbkcmpkv2.jpg","description":"The Granstream Saga (グランストリーム伝記 Guransutorīmu Denki) is an action role-playing game for the PlayStation 1.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"PlayStation: 5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game","createdAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","updatedAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","_id":"c48f9035dfc747478d5ef2fcfb1c5338","name":"The Granstream Saga","extraData":["Sony PlayStation exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The Granstream Saga","details":["Sony PlayStation exclusive"],"id":"psx455","igdbId":19156,"gbId":11768,"gbGuid":"3030-11768","tgdbId":12085,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony PlayStation","id":"ccl20","igdbId":7,"gbId":22,"gbGuid":"3045-22","tgdbId":10}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":19156,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":"5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game"},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 2","consoleId":8},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 3","consoleId":9}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"07/23/2009","total_rating":85,"esrb":"E","videos":["JcqPmTksZg4","wWo6zYZx2rM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2etg.jpg","description":"Set off on a journey to a tropical island where an array of fun activities await.

Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link's Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.  Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.  Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.  Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.  Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.  Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.  The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Fair","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","_id":"256dd29f6bff442a829e4c71de2f22c0","name":"Link's Crossbow Training","extraData":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","details":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"id":"wii166","igdbId":4973,"gbId":1074,"gbGuid":"3030-1074","tgdbId":2248,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii","id":"ccl5","igdbId":5,"gbId":36,"gbGuid":"3045-36","tgdbId":9}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":4973,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","condition":"Fair","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Wii U","consoleId":41}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/17/2011","total_rating":87,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["SMkvcKhVCEk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/crc3jclnlyzp90gdhmuc.jpg","description":"Skyward Sword is the sixteenth entry in the Legend of Zelda series.

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","story":"The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location. \n \nThe chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story. \n \nIn 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-04-16","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","updatedAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","_id":"5a12b44cc1f34e58bf28237fda8fc1ad","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc22","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Adventure","Horror"],"id":3907,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"physical":true,"pricePaid":60,"datePurchased":"2020-04-16","howAcquired":"eBay","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/01/2008","total_rating":51,"esrb":"E","videos":["BscGJ22dog8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dee.jpg","description":"Prince of Persia: The Fallen King is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Casablanca.[1] The game was released for the Nintendo DS in December 2008, as a spin-off of Prince of Persia.

It is a reimagining of the first installment in the series, MediEvil, with many alterations to the original structure and content, such as the addition of the \"Anubis Stone\" sub-plot which never appeared in the original. Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.","story":"In 1286, an evil wizard named Zarok sought to take over the Kingdom of Gallowmere. Legends tell of a brave knight named Sir Daniel Fortesque who slayed the evil wizard and brought peace to Gallowmere. In actuality, however, Dan was the first to die in the Battle of Gallowmere, struck down by an arrow in the eye during the first charge. A century later, in 1386, Zarok returns and casts a spell over Gallowmere, robbing the souls of its people and raising the dead. This spell also resurrects Dan, who is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie who was robbed of his powers by Zarok and cursed to reside in Dan's skull. Seeing his resurrection as a chance to prove himself a true hero, Dan goes on a quest to seek revenge against Zarok, collecting pieces of an artifact called the Anubis Stone along the way. After collecting all the pieces and making his way to Zarok's lair, Dan is confronted by Zarok and his immortal army, but Dan manages to stop this army by using the Anubis Stone to summon the souls of those who fought in the Battle of Gallowmere. Zarok transforms into a cobra and a last-ditch attempt, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok perishes, he sets his lair to self-destruct in the hopes of taking Dan down with him, but Dan is saved by Al-Zalam, who had been freed from his curse upon Zarok's demise. As peace returns to Gallowmere, Dan returns to his eternal rest, where he finally earns his place as a true hero in the Hall of Heroes.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-11-09","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","updatedAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","_id":"cd6aa89da33b42df85ab85efcf52b32b","name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp151","igdbId":4005,"gbId":14258,"gbGuid":"3030-14258","tgdbId":7099,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":4005,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"physical":true,"pricePaid":5,"datePurchased":"2019-11-09","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/23/2006","total_rating":62,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zvh.jpg","description":"The game begins with Doctor Eggman turning Tails, Amy Rose, Rouge, and the Master Emerald into cards with his new device.

Players can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":10,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","_id":"b483bde39e644679b86f1f24f4de534f","name":"Forza Motorsport 4","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Forza Motorsport 4","details":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"id":"x360284","igdbId":3068,"gbId":33400,"gbGuid":"3030-33400","tgdbId":8864,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"id":3068,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"physical":true,"pricePaid":10,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/21/2009","total_rating":85,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m1qtsn4ehaen83bbp1ee.jpg","description":"Forza Motorsport 3 is a racing video game developed for Xbox 360 by Turn 10 Studios.

The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-16","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","_id":"b7cac09307d44165bad3fe268744f7dc","name":"Crackdown 2","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","story":"Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three crime organizations: Los Muertos (which means \"the dead\" in Spanish), of Central American origin; an Eastern European gang, the Volk (Russian for Wolf) ; and the formerly above-board Shai-Gen Corporation, from East Asia. Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \"the Agency\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \"Agents\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. \nThroughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders and subordinates of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-06","howAcquired":"XBOX Store","notes":"Xbox 360: Free to celebrate Crackdown 3 coming out soon","createdAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","updatedAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","_id":"d5ea00afab3c47c7b234fc4bf8c31d4e","name":"Crackdown","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

To help stamp out a mysterious metalbug infestation, Daxter takes on a job as a pest exterminator, enabling him to explore parts of Haven City in an effort to collect the clues that will lead him to Jak. Daxter allows gamers to play from his perspective offering a distinctive set of moves with agile abilities that allows players to climb walls, creep up on enemies, fit in small places and maneuver vehicles. Taking a job as a pest exterminator, to fight an ongoing invasion of metal-bugs, Daxter comes equip with gadgets to rid the city of these metal nuisances. Get close up and personal by using your flimsy bug swatter to squash an army of attacking insects or your spray gun to hover around a variety of environments while picking up various upgrades.","story":"The game takes place in the final months of the 2-year gap presented in the opening of Jak II (and the aftermath of The Precursor Legacy), between the moment when Jak is taken prisoner by the Krimzon Guard and the time in which Daxter finally rescues him from the Krimzon Guard Fortress. The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as 'Metal Bugs'. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter's interest in her, occasionally helps him. \n \nAfter completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter's pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo's son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis' palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader. \n \nWhen Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter's Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess and Taryn.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-01-26","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","updatedAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","_id":"9f7c8e517a2a448bbd18d30041fc84f2","name":"Daxter","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Daxter","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp62","igdbId":1533,"gbId":14604,"gbGuid":"3030-14604","tgdbId":7078,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform","Simulator","Strategy"],"id":1533,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2019-01-26","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","condition":"Excellent","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/16/2003","total_rating":91,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1uok.jpg","description":"Project Gotham Racing 2 is a racing game for the Xbox, developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Microsoft.

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.  The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...  Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.  Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts.

Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America.  The Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a \"Photo Mode\", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes.  The pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the \"Nathan Drake Pack\", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme.  Purchasing The Nathan Drake Collection, and owning a valid subscription to PlayStation Plus, before the expiry date of December 13, 2015 would grant the player exclusive access to the multiplayer beta of A Thief's End.","story":"Uncharted: \nTreasure hunter Nathan \"Nate\" Drake (Nolan North), accompanied by reporter Elena Fisher (Emily Rose), recovers the coffin of his self-proclaimed ancestor Sir Francis Drake, having located it from coordinates inscribed on a family heirloom: a ring Nate wears around his neck. The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Nate's boat, but Nate's friend and mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) rescues the two in his seaplane. Fearing Elena's reporting will attract potential rivals, Nate and Sully abandon her at a dock. \n \nFollowing the diary to the indicated spot, Nate and Sully discover an alcove that once held a large statue, and realize that El Dorado is not a city but rather a golden idol. They find a Nazi U-boat, which contains a page from Drake's diary showing the statue was taken to an island. However, mercenaries led by criminal Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman) and his lieutenant Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes) intercept Nate and Sully. Sully is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest, but Nate manages to escape, encounters Elena, and flies with her to the island. \n \nOn the way, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Nate to bail out and they are separated. After retrieving supplies from the wrecked seaplane, Nate heads toward an old fort to find Elena. Briefly captured by pirates led by old associate Eddy Raja (James Sie), Elena breaks Nate free and they flee to the island's old customs house. After finding records showing the statue was moved further inland, they find that Sully is alive and accompanying Roman and Raja. Nate and Elena find and rescue Sully who, having survived due to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, explains he was buying time for Nate by giving Roman misinformation. \n \n \nUncharted 2: \nTwo years after the events of the first game, treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Nolan North) is approached by former associate Harry Flynn (Steve Valentine) and Flynn's girlfriend Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) to help steal a Mongolian oil lamp connected to Marco Polo's doomed 1292 voyage from China. The group plans to cheat Flynn's client and take Polo's treasure for themselves. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Nate had worked together before, and Chloe plans on blackmailing Flynn and escaping with Nate and whatever treasure they find. \n \nNate and Flynn break into a museum in Istanbul and find the lamp, which contains a map and flammable resin that reveals Polo's fleet was shipwrecked in Borneo, and was carrying the Cintamani Stone from the fabled city of Shambhala. Flynn double-crosses Nate, leaving him to be arrested. \n \nThree months later, Chloe helps free Nate with his longtime friend Victor Sullivan (Richard McGonagle). She reveals that Flynn is working for Zoran Lazarević (Graham McTavish), a Serbian war criminal seeking the stone. In Borneo, Nate and Sully infiltrate Lazarević's camp, with Chloe as a mole. Nate discovers that the stone never left Shambhala, and locates a temple containing the bodies of Polo's crew, as well as a phurba and map detailing that its carrier will gain passage to Shambhala through a temple in Nepal. Nate and Sully escape after being cornered by Flynn and his men. \n \n \nUncharted 3: \nThe story begins with Nathan \"Nate\" Drake (Nolan North) and Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) entering a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot (Robin Atkin Downes), who is interested in purchasing Nate's ring. During the meeting, Nate and Sully accuse Talbot of offering them counterfeit banknotes, and a fight ensues. After fighting their way past Talbot's thugs, Nate and Sully emerge in an alleyway, where they are surrounded and subdued by Charlie Cutter (Graham McTavish), Talbot's cohort. They are then approached by Talbot's client, Katherine Marlowe (Rosalind Ayres), who steals Drake's ring. Nate attempts to go after her, but Cutter guns him and Sully down, seemingly killing them. \n \nThe story flashes back to 20 years earlier, where a teenage Nathan Drake (Billy Unger) explores a museum in Cartagena, Colombia, in search of Sir Francis Drake's ring, but is thrown out after guards suspect him of being a thief. Intrigued by the actions of Victor Sullivan, who he does not know at this point, Nate follows Sully to a keymaker and pickpockets him, before returning to the museum. He steals the ring, but before he can leave he is caught by Marlowe, her henchmen, and Sully, who was working for her. Nate flees with the ring, with Marlowe's agents in pursuit, but Sully rescues Nate from the agents and decides to act as a mentor to him.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"03/20/2020 10:14 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 10:14 pm","_id":"4a960596c0e14006b1398d30138b2efb","name":"Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 4 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection","details":["Sony PlayStation 4 full exclusive"],"id":"sps4678","igdbId":10962,"gbId":49843,"gbGuid":"3030-49843","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 4","id":"ccl23","igdbId":48,"gbId":146,"gbGuid":"3045-146","tgdbId":4919}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure","Third-person shooter"],"id":10962,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"physical":"","pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["digital"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"04/03/2017","total_rating":62,"videos":["9oOkUoF__Ns"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g0s.jpg","description":"After 20 years since his debut, PaRappa the Rapper returns to PlayStation!

The Wii U GamePad controller makes it so easy for anyone to create levels; it may feel like simply sketching out ideas on paper. Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world.  The game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","_id":"fc0d9032824e4f21836d8348df9bd516","name":"Super Mario Maker","extraData":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Mario Maker","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"id":"wiiu354","igdbId":7339,"gbId":46580,"gbGuid":"3030-46580","tgdbId":31277,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform"],"id":7339,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"physical":true,"pricePaid":60,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Excellent","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/20/2013","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E","videos":["PwwjcfgTksU","wLOKVABfrzw","vZSwQX30DUs","ID4UYlhyJR0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21vd.jpg","description":"Super Mario 3D World is a 3D platformer action game for the Wii U, and a follow-up of the Nintendo 3DS installment Super Mario 3D Land. The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","story":"While having a walk in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario, Toad and Peach, and Luigi happen on one of the many green pipes, yet a special one.

Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get. \n \nF-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off. \n \nFalcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil. \n \nAt his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","_id":"0d78a523fa284c2e85dbeb33a9d7ecc6","name":"F-Zero GX","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc24","name":"F-Zero X","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3492,"gbId":20448,"gbGuid":"3030-20448","tgdbId":10836,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing"],"id":3492,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/01/2004","total_rating":74,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/quebpemarsck9hdl7qup.jpg","description":"Polarium mixes way-cool gameplay with an electronica soundtrack for the trippiest experience yet on the DS.

It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.  The game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Auditory"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","_id":"bdb83b0c8f5742a59793822c99182725","name":"Guitar Hero","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Guitar Hero","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps2202","igdbId":1285,"gbId":6311,"gbGuid":"3030-6311","tgdbId":7189,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Music"],"id":1285,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"04/26/2007","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E10+","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/glhvm0aa35vusswngyo3.jpg","description":"Buzz!: The Mega Quiz released as Buzz!

Each color-coded track corresponds to a different aspect of the song, such as percussion, synth, bass, or vocals, and contains a sequence of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is \"captured\" and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:32 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:32 am","_id":"038d2cddcaf645869537f22968a501fd","name":"Amplitude","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Amplitude","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps226","igdbId":2141,"gbId":1420,"gbGuid":"3030-1420","tgdbId":36610,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Music","Adventure"],"id":2141,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false}]
