This fear-fueled first-person shooter invites takes all the horror, chaos and tension found in the best of the horror genre and adds original interactive elements, including a unique death mechanic that puts players in the body of a different survivor each time they die, allowing them to track and take down their old, infected characters, recover their equipment and see if they can stay alive just a little bit longer this time.","story":"For the second time in history, a great plague has enveloped London in a fog of death. Big Ben tolls as hundreds upon thousands of the unprepared die or are infected by a sickness worse than death... \n \nYou are still breathing for now, but how long will you survive in the labyrinth of London streets and underground?

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.  L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.  The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.  The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","story":"Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":2.5,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:17 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:17 pm","_id":"d7d867e272ba4e80aebd315639a2f665","name":"L.A.

Duncan can sense the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which means that this would be the first true Blight in over 400 years. It is of utmost importance that this Blight is ended before it can gain momentum, as previous Blights have left Thedas all but in ruins.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":2,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:17 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:17 pm","_id":"3701d6da9b654e838aff724dc8616514","name":"Dragon Age: Origins","extraData":["Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One - Available in the Vault of EA Access","banned in UAE: Banned likely due to sexual themes, including possible homosexual relationships.

The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers – mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks – Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one. Some Hordes roam the highways at night, while others, like the one in the demo, have found a food source that keeps it in a single location. Skills learned in his prior life as an outlaw biker have given Deacon a slight edge in the seemingly never-ending fight to stay alive.

Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features.","story":"Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. \nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. \nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. \nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. \nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. \nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. \nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":8,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-10-01","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","updatedAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","_id":"4b4fd6f0f2544f65b08d3bebc24a31d5","name":"Battlefield 4","extraData":["banned in China: Banned for discrediting China's national image as well as threatening national security.

The player controls a space ship in the bottom part of the screen and shoots at enemies descending from the top of the screen.   The game was received very well by the public and has continued to be a game with a competitive community to this day. It was followed by a successful sequel called Galaga in 1981 and two less known sequels called Gaplus in 1984 and Galaga '88 in 1987.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":29.41,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-09-12","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","updatedAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","_id":"db24c073581847fd992221cd2a99fdca","name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"id":5565,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":29.41,"datePurchased":"2020-09-12","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/30/1983","total_rating":47,"esrb":"E","videos":["zlNqtY76ho0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/z6xrk4qkqerfdrvsgkin.jpg","description":"The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling.

Although the player controls Fox for almost the entirety of the game, the first level of Star Fox Adventures involves playing as another fox called Krystal, who speaks another language, from a different planet called Cerinia.  Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.  Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.  Fox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.  Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.  To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.  Fox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.  In order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.  Prince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick.  As you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu.  There are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time.  The game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi.  It is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games.  When engaged with an enemy, the combat is real time, meaning each of Fox's movements in combat require the press of the A button, similar to how each sword swing in Zelda or Skyrim require the press of a button.","story":"Fox Mccloud investigates a planet on the edge of the Lylat System called Dinosaur Planet, which is falling apart.

The Worlds are populated by NPC's, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney's Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the \"Heartless\" forms the other.  Successful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes.  The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency \"Munny\", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated. Such items include those used to restore HP and MP, items to aid party members or synthesis materials which can be used to create weapons and armor.","story":"The universe of Kingdom Hearts is a collection of various levels, referred to as \"worlds\", through which the player must progress. Thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game. \n \nThe graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the world are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship. \n \nThe worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several Final Fantasy games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the Final Fantasy characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each \"Keyhole\"; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance. \n \nKingdom Hearts begins with Sora's Dive to the Heart, which foreshadows the events that will soon take place, but soon progresses to Destiny Islands, where Sora lives with his two best friends, Riku and Kairi. The three friends seek to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose. One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures. Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku first; Riku disappears into darkness, curious about what it contains. Soon after, Sora obtains a mysterious weapon, the Keyblade, to defend himself. Using it to fend off the creatures, he heads for a secret cave, where he finds Kairi near a door. She turns to him, saying his name as the door behind her blows open. The ensuing blast of darkness sends Sora and Kairi both out of the cave. The islands are soon destroyed, and Sora is left adrift, Riku and Kairi's whereabouts unknown.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"PlayStation 2: 5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game","createdAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","updatedAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","_id":"a2a761e50c5c46a0ad3955a288c9fbed","name":"Kingdom Hearts","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Kingdom Hearts","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps2243","igdbId":1219,"gbId":10983,"gbGuid":"3030-10983","tgdbId":2559,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Sport"],"id":1219,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":"5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game"}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/05/1997","esrb":"T","videos":["LmTLexOJIM4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mxausltymd3nbkcmpkv2.jpg","description":"The Granstream Saga (グランストリーム伝記 Guransutorīmu Denki) is an action role-playing game for the PlayStation 1.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"PlayStation: 5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game","createdAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","updatedAt":"07/07/2020 12:28 pm","_id":"c48f9035dfc747478d5ef2fcfb1c5338","name":"The Granstream Saga","extraData":["Sony PlayStation exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"The Granstream Saga","details":["Sony PlayStation exclusive"],"id":"psx455","igdbId":19156,"gbId":11768,"gbGuid":"3030-11768","tgdbId":12085,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony PlayStation","id":"ccl20","igdbId":7,"gbId":22,"gbGuid":"3045-22","tgdbId":10}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":19156,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-07-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":"5 games this month so could say $40 divided by 5 = $8 per game"},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 2","consoleId":8},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 3","consoleId":9}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/19/2007","total_rating":88,"esrb":"M","videos":["-_6ZMr2bMco"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1x7o.jpg","description":"What starts as a routine mission to an agrarian outpost quickly becomes the opening salvo in an epic war.

Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities.

Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link's Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.  Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.  Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.  Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.  Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.  Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.  The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Fair","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","_id":"256dd29f6bff442a829e4c71de2f22c0","name":"Link's Crossbow Training","extraData":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","details":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"id":"wii166","igdbId":4973,"gbId":1074,"gbGuid":"3030-1074","tgdbId":2248,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii","id":"ccl5","igdbId":5,"gbId":36,"gbGuid":"3045-36","tgdbId":9}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":4973,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","condition":"Fair","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Wii U","consoleId":41}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/17/2011","total_rating":87,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["SMkvcKhVCEk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/crc3jclnlyzp90gdhmuc.jpg","description":"Skyward Sword is the sixteenth entry in the Legend of Zelda series.

It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings.

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name.  Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer.  A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-05-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","updatedAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","_id":"7bfda36d16354cf6943e1c53cc0d3b23","name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":47321,"name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360"],"id":"xbox452","gbId":17491,"gbGuid":"3030-17491","tgdbId":8037,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":47321,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-05-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"06/22/2002","total_rating":86,"esrb":"M","videos":["w5__J4JCyMg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1sa8.jpg","description":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a psychological horror action adventure, released in 2002 by Nintendo for the Gamecube. It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","story":"The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location. \n \nThe chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story. \n \nIn 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-04-16","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","updatedAt":"04/17/2020 05:06 am","_id":"5a12b44cc1f34e58bf28237fda8fc1ad","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc22","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Adventure","Horror"],"id":3907,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"physical":true,"pricePaid":60,"datePurchased":"2020-04-16","howAcquired":"eBay","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"01/04/2010","total_rating":81,"esrb":"M","videos":["ArHzEGeiMbg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29t0.jpg","description":"Apocalyptic power of War: Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.

It is a side-scrolling platformer much in the vein of the previous Super Mario Bros. This time, Mario must save Princess Daisy, rather than Princess Toadstool, from her kidnapper Tatanga, a mysterious spaceman. The game follows largely the same formula of its aforementioned predecessor, with Mario defeating enemies by jumping on them and collecting coins and power ups by hitting floating blocks, with each world leading up to a boss fight which is defeated using by collapsing the floor. A unique feature of this instalment is two scrolling shoot-'em-up levels, the first of which Mario pilots a submarine, and the second an aeroplane.","story":"Once upon a time, there was a peaceful world called Sarasaland.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.  Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.  The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.  At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life.

If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).

Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis: original release without \"Not for resale\"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","_id":"d0a1f25adb5443fa8ea0eeab5c953b1d","name":"Sonic the Hedgehog","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd217","name":"Sonic The Hedgehog","igdbId":3192,"gbId":2465,"gbGuid":"3030-2465","tgdbId":40416,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":3192,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":20,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":"original release without \"Not for resale\""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"03/03/2008","total_rating":68,"esrb":"M","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vcwjaimr3yjtt09wkymx.jpg","description":"Army Of Two throws gamers into hot spots ripped from current day headlines where they will utilize unique two-man strategies and tactics while seamlessly transitioning between playing with intelligent Partner AI (PAI) and a live player.

It is a reimagining of the first installment in the series, MediEvil, with many alterations to the original structure and content, such as the addition of the \"Anubis Stone\" sub-plot which never appeared in the original. Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.","story":"In 1286, an evil wizard named Zarok sought to take over the Kingdom of Gallowmere. Legends tell of a brave knight named Sir Daniel Fortesque who slayed the evil wizard and brought peace to Gallowmere. In actuality, however, Dan was the first to die in the Battle of Gallowmere, struck down by an arrow in the eye during the first charge. A century later, in 1386, Zarok returns and casts a spell over Gallowmere, robbing the souls of its people and raising the dead. This spell also resurrects Dan, who is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie who was robbed of his powers by Zarok and cursed to reside in Dan's skull. Seeing his resurrection as a chance to prove himself a true hero, Dan goes on a quest to seek revenge against Zarok, collecting pieces of an artifact called the Anubis Stone along the way. After collecting all the pieces and making his way to Zarok's lair, Dan is confronted by Zarok and his immortal army, but Dan manages to stop this army by using the Anubis Stone to summon the souls of those who fought in the Battle of Gallowmere. Zarok transforms into a cobra and a last-ditch attempt, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok perishes, he sets his lair to self-destruct in the hopes of taking Dan down with him, but Dan is saved by Al-Zalam, who had been freed from his curse upon Zarok's demise. As peace returns to Gallowmere, Dan returns to his eternal rest, where he finally earns his place as a true hero in the Hall of Heroes.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-11-09","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","updatedAt":"11/10/2019 06:35 am","_id":"cd6aa89da33b42df85ab85efcf52b32b","name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"MediEvil: Resurrection","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp151","igdbId":4005,"gbId":14258,"gbGuid":"3030-14258","tgdbId":7099,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":4005,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"physical":true,"pricePaid":5,"datePurchased":"2019-11-09","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/23/2006","total_rating":62,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zvh.jpg","description":"The game begins with Doctor Eggman turning Tails, Amy Rose, Rouge, and the Master Emerald into cards with his new device.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. When part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. Occasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-07-25","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"07/28/2019 08:37 am","updatedAt":"07/28/2019 08:37 am","_id":"fd7dd4f4c6c04a67b2aba54ed2cc9656","name":"Lumines","extraData":["Sony PSP launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"spsp141","name":"Lumines","details":["Sony PSP launch title"],"igdbId":4689,"gbId":5057,"gbGuid":"3030-5057","tgdbId":7095,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Puzzle"],"id":4689,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2019-07-25","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/29/1984","total_rating":71,"esrb":"E","videos":["fRgMCtaWoSU","IkjVodjgWU8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qnxgsxijvvejjrjrgxdf.jpg","description":"Excitebike (エキサイトバイク Ekisaitobaiku) is a motocross racing video game franchise made by Nintendo.

Players can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":10,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","updatedAt":"03/23/2019 03:50 pm","_id":"b483bde39e644679b86f1f24f4de534f","name":"Forza Motorsport 4","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Forza Motorsport 4","details":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive"],"id":"x360284","igdbId":3068,"gbId":33400,"gbGuid":"3030-33400","tgdbId":8864,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Microsoft Xbox 360","id":"ccl26","igdbId":12,"gbId":20,"gbGuid":"3045-20","tgdbId":15}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Sport"],"id":3068,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"physical":true,"pricePaid":10,"datePurchased":"2019-03-23","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/21/2009","total_rating":85,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m1qtsn4ehaen83bbp1ee.jpg","description":"Forza Motorsport 3 is a racing video game developed for Xbox 360 by Turn 10 Studios.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.  The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-16","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","_id":"b7cac09307d44165bad3fe268744f7dc","name":"Crackdown 2","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself.

Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","story":"Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three crime organizations: Los Muertos (which means \"the dead\" in Spanish), of Central American origin; an Eastern European gang, the Volk (Russian for Wolf) ; and the formerly above-board Shai-Gen Corporation, from East Asia. Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \"the Agency\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \"Agents\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. \nThroughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders and subordinates of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-06","howAcquired":"XBOX Store","notes":"Xbox 360: Free to celebrate Crackdown 3 coming out soon","createdAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","updatedAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","_id":"d5ea00afab3c47c7b234fc4bf8c31d4e","name":"Crackdown","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

The story unfolds as Daxter searches for Jak, who was imprisoned during the events that led to the start of \"Jak II.\" Daxter, now on his own in an unfamiliar place, quickly realizes that being small and furry won't help his chances of survival. To help stamp out a mysterious metalbug infestation, Daxter takes on a job as a pest exterminator, enabling him to explore parts of Haven City in an effort to collect the clues that will lead him to Jak. Daxter allows gamers to play from his perspective offering a distinctive set of moves with agile abilities that allows players to climb walls, creep up on enemies, fit in small places and maneuver vehicles. Taking a job as a pest exterminator, to fight an ongoing invasion of metal-bugs, Daxter comes equip with gadgets to rid the city of these metal nuisances. Get close up and personal by using your flimsy bug swatter to squash an army of attacking insects or your spray gun to hover around a variety of environments while picking up various upgrades.","story":"The game takes place in the final months of the 2-year gap presented in the opening of Jak II (and the aftermath of The Precursor Legacy), between the moment when Jak is taken prisoner by the Krimzon Guard and the time in which Daxter finally rescues him from the Krimzon Guard Fortress. The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as 'Metal Bugs'. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter's interest in her, occasionally helps him. \n \nAfter completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter's pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo's son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis' palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader. \n \nWhen Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter's Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess and Taryn.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-01-26","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","updatedAt":"01/27/2019 07:38 am","_id":"9f7c8e517a2a448bbd18d30041fc84f2","name":"Daxter","extraData":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Daxter","details":["Sony PlayStation Portable exclusive"],"id":"spsp62","igdbId":1533,"gbId":14604,"gbGuid":"3030-14604","tgdbId":7078,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation Portable","id":"ccl24","igdbId":38,"gbId":18,"gbGuid":"3045-18","tgdbId":13}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform","Simulator","Strategy"],"id":1533,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation Portable","consoleId":38,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2019-01-26","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","condition":"Excellent","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/16/2003","total_rating":91,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1uok.jpg","description":"Project Gotham Racing 2 is a racing game for the Xbox, developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Microsoft.

It is the second game in the Soul series, preceded by Soul Edge (1996). Originally released in arcades in 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. In 1999 it was ported to the Dreamcast with improved graphics and new features. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is one of the most critically acclaimed fighting games of all time.","story":"The mystical sword of the legends, the \"Soul Edge\", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years, he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \"Evil Seed\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake. \n \nThree years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them, three sacred weapons join once again.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2018-12-27","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","updatedAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","_id":"3615c618feef470bbc8674bebb5226a3","name":"SoulCalibur","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"SoulCalibur","id":"sdc60","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":1564,"gbId":12411,"gbGuid":"3030-12411","tgdbId":7767,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"id":1564,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2018-12-27","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"01/06/2003","total_rating":67,"esrb":"E","videos":["BWBOk_AaiHc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yt2.jpg","description":"Crash is back and ready to take on an all-new nefarious villain.

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.  The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...  Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.  Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts.

Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America.  The Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a \"Photo Mode\", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes.  The pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the \"Nathan Drake Pack\", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme.  Purchasing The Nathan Drake Collection, and owning a valid subscription to PlayStation Plus, before the expiry date of December 13, 2015 would grant the player exclusive access to the multiplayer beta of A Thief's End.","story":"Uncharted: \nTreasure hunter Nathan \"Nate\" Drake (Nolan North), accompanied by reporter Elena Fisher (Emily Rose), recovers the coffin of his self-proclaimed ancestor Sir Francis Drake, having located it from coordinates inscribed on a family heirloom: a ring Nate wears around his neck. The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Nate's boat, but Nate's friend and mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) rescues the two in his seaplane. Fearing Elena's reporting will attract potential rivals, Nate and Sully abandon her at a dock. \n \nFollowing the diary to the indicated spot, Nate and Sully discover an alcove that once held a large statue, and realize that El Dorado is not a city but rather a golden idol. They find a Nazi U-boat, which contains a page from Drake's diary showing the statue was taken to an island. However, mercenaries led by criminal Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman) and his lieutenant Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes) intercept Nate and Sully. Sully is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest, but Nate manages to escape, encounters Elena, and flies with her to the island. \n \nOn the way, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Nate to bail out and they are separated. After retrieving supplies from the wrecked seaplane, Nate heads toward an old fort to find Elena. Briefly captured by pirates led by old associate Eddy Raja (James Sie), Elena breaks Nate free and they flee to the island's old customs house. After finding records showing the statue was moved further inland, they find that Sully is alive and accompanying Roman and Raja. Nate and Elena find and rescue Sully who, having survived due to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, explains he was buying time for Nate by giving Roman misinformation. \n \n \nUncharted 2: \nTwo years after the events of the first game, treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Nolan North) is approached by former associate Harry Flynn (Steve Valentine) and Flynn's girlfriend Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) to help steal a Mongolian oil lamp connected to Marco Polo's doomed 1292 voyage from China. The group plans to cheat Flynn's client and take Polo's treasure for themselves. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Nate had worked together before, and Chloe plans on blackmailing Flynn and escaping with Nate and whatever treasure they find. \n \nNate and Flynn break into a museum in Istanbul and find the lamp, which contains a map and flammable resin that reveals Polo's fleet was shipwrecked in Borneo, and was carrying the Cintamani Stone from the fabled city of Shambhala. Flynn double-crosses Nate, leaving him to be arrested. \n \nThree months later, Chloe helps free Nate with his longtime friend Victor Sullivan (Richard McGonagle). She reveals that Flynn is working for Zoran Lazarević (Graham McTavish), a Serbian war criminal seeking the stone. In Borneo, Nate and Sully infiltrate Lazarević's camp, with Chloe as a mole. Nate discovers that the stone never left Shambhala, and locates a temple containing the bodies of Polo's crew, as well as a phurba and map detailing that its carrier will gain passage to Shambhala through a temple in Nepal. Nate and Sully escape after being cornered by Flynn and his men. \n \n \nUncharted 3: \nThe story begins with Nathan \"Nate\" Drake (Nolan North) and Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) entering a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot (Robin Atkin Downes), who is interested in purchasing Nate's ring. During the meeting, Nate and Sully accuse Talbot of offering them counterfeit banknotes, and a fight ensues. After fighting their way past Talbot's thugs, Nate and Sully emerge in an alleyway, where they are surrounded and subdued by Charlie Cutter (Graham McTavish), Talbot's cohort. They are then approached by Talbot's client, Katherine Marlowe (Rosalind Ayres), who steals Drake's ring. Nate attempts to go after her, but Cutter guns him and Sully down, seemingly killing them. \n \nThe story flashes back to 20 years earlier, where a teenage Nathan Drake (Billy Unger) explores a museum in Cartagena, Colombia, in search of Sir Francis Drake's ring, but is thrown out after guards suspect him of being a thief. Intrigued by the actions of Victor Sullivan, who he does not know at this point, Nate follows Sully to a keymaker and pickpockets him, before returning to the museum. He steals the ring, but before he can leave he is caught by Marlowe, her henchmen, and Sully, who was working for her. Nate flees with the ring, with Marlowe's agents in pursuit, but Sully rescues Nate from the agents and decides to act as a mentor to him.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"03/20/2020 10:14 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 10:14 pm","_id":"4a960596c0e14006b1398d30138b2efb","name":"Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 4 full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection","details":["Sony PlayStation 4 full exclusive"],"id":"sps4678","igdbId":10962,"gbId":49843,"gbGuid":"3030-49843","isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 4","id":"ccl23","igdbId":48,"gbId":146,"gbGuid":"3045-146","tgdbId":4919}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure","Third-person shooter"],"id":10962,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"physical":"","pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"PSN","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["digital"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"04/03/2017","total_rating":62,"videos":["9oOkUoF__Ns"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g0s.jpg","description":"After 20 years since his debut, PaRappa the Rapper returns to PlayStation!

For example, the Xbox One version was not released until some time after the console itself was officially launched in September 2014. The PC version remains unavailable, consequently blocking access to the downloadable version on Steam. Due to the fact Ubisoft cannot officially distribute their games on Nintendo consoles specifically for the Middle East (for various reasons), the Wii U version remains unavailable (Ubisoft games on Nintendo consoles are generally available as imported products in the region)."],"id":"bi169","igdbId":1121,"gbId":38538,"gbGuid":"3030-38538","tgdbId":10284}],"genres":["Shooter","Racing","Adventure"],"id":1121,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameStop","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"04/11/2016","total_rating":83,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["iFSf-6m6bEM","muk_6PItjKs","Eeti22Z5lqw","yHIqTE1wnW4","kJeAnmfbQp4","WFh4kXr-IpU","i-f0PyD4PYI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co230k.jpg","description":"Ratchet & Clank is a new game based on elements from the original Ratchet & Clank (PS2), featuring more than an hour of new cinematics (including footage from the film) in vibrant 1080p, new locations, weapons, bosses and more.

Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world.  The game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":60,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 05:54 am","_id":"fc0d9032824e4f21836d8348df9bd516","name":"Super Mario Maker","extraData":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Mario Maker","details":["Nintendo Wii U full exclusive"],"id":"wiiu354","igdbId":7339,"gbId":46580,"gbGuid":"3030-46580","tgdbId":31277,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform"],"id":7339,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"physical":true,"pricePaid":60,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Excellent","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/20/2013","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E","videos":["PwwjcfgTksU","wLOKVABfrzw","vZSwQX30DUs","ID4UYlhyJR0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21vd.jpg","description":"Super Mario 3D World is a 3D platformer action game for the Wii U, and a follow-up of the Nintendo 3DS installment Super Mario 3D Land.

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","story":"While having a walk in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario, Toad and Peach, and Luigi happen on one of the many green pipes, yet a special one.

The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Underworld where he fights through giant leeches, Chinese dragon-headed rattlesnakes, and ferocious Chicken Stingers (resembling the ones from Golden Axe). The centurion turns into a humanoid thunder dragon in order to fight Neff in the form of Octeyes. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Cavern of Souls where he fights through Cave Needles (which resemble giant ants), turtle/snail hybrids, and zombies known as Grave Masters. The centurion turns into a humanoid bear in order to fight Neff in the form of Mouldy Snail. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion arrives at Neff's palace where he fights through zombies, Chicken Stingers, and Hammer Demons. The centurion turns into a humanoid tiger in order to fight Neff in the form of Crocodile Worm. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nAfter the centurion arrives in Dis, he fights through winged demons, Goat Men, Boar Men, saw fishes, and purple Unicorn Men to get to Neff. When the centurion confronts Neff, the centurion becomes a golden werewolf while Neff transforms into a Rhinoceros-Man. After he is defeated, a blue bird comes out of the ground and transforms back to Athena. Afterwards she is shown holding arms with her lycanthropic hero, thanking him for rescuing her. \nIn the original arcade, the end credits are interspersed with images of actors in costumes for the different characters and monsters of the game, implying the whole game was a film production.[2]","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","updatedAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","_id":"77c1cd2d3c9e4457869c528a33a0059f","name":"Altered Beast","extraData":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Altered Beast","id":"smd7","details":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"igdbId":2604,"gbId":2536,"gbGuid":"3030-2536","tgdbId":118,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"id":2604,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/17/2003","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2d2m.jpg","description":"Can you outrun the Empire?

They must stop Doctor Eggman from stealing the seven Chaos Emeralds and feeding them to Chaos, a monster known as \"the God of Destruction\". The first in the Sonic the Hedgehog series to feature free-roaming 3D gameplay, Sonic Adventure features two game modes: Adventure and Trial. There are different goals for each character in the game: Sonic involves high speed gameplay, while Tails must reach the end of the level before Sonic does, and Knuckles searches the area for shards of the Master Emerald. Each of the three characters retain many of their trademark moves from previous Sonic games, such as Tails being able to fly for short periods of time, and Knuckles being able to glide through the air, though they can use updated techniques as well. The rest of the playable cast is rounded out by Amy, who must use her hammer to escape from Eggman's E-100 Zero robot chasing after her, Gamma, who must use its laser beam to shoot through levels to reach a target, and Big, who fishes in efforts to find his friend, Froggy.  The \"Adventure Mode\" is a one-player game which consists of two areas, the \"Adventure Field\" and an \"Action Stage\". The Adventure Field contains several \"Events\" that are encountered in the course of the story, while the Action Stages have each character fulfilling a goal to clear the stage. Players may also find hidden Chao Gardens, a protective environment inhabited by Chao, a sort of virtual pet. The player can hatch, raise and interact with a Chao. Chao can be taken with the player by downloading the minigame Chao Adventure to their VMU, or in the GameCube version, a Game Boy Advance with Sonic Advance or various other Game Boy Advance Sonic games. The player can also raise their stats by giving them small animals that they found by defeating the robots, which improves their performance in Chao Races. There are also eggs hidden throughout the Adventure Fields which can produce special types of Chao.  By playing through Action Stages and Subgames, searching through the Adventure Fields or winning Chao Races, players can earn Emblems. In the case of Action Stages, each one has three Emblems, which can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling certain objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.","story":"Sonic Adventure is set on Angel Island, an island floating above Earth. The Ancient Echidna Tribe's ruler, Pachacamac, plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe attack the shrine, attempting to use the emeralds for their own gain. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos and kills them. Following Chaos' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald. \n \nThree thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik shatters the Master Emerald and sets Chaos free. As a result, Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In the city of Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog battles Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles \"Tails\" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' Emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails resolve to search for the emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Eggman and Chaos. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, and shoots down Sonic and Tails' pursuing plane. \n \nEggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training. He orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos's tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy's owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird in possession of a Chaos Emerald and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie's location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdie and detains them both on the Egg Carrier, with Sonic and Tails using the Tornado II to follow them on board. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald. \n \nOn board the Egg Carrier, Eggman calls out the E-Series robots for their failure and removes them before stationing Gamma in Amy's cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt and Amy convinces Gamma that he should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship's deck. She meets up with Sonic and Tails, but Eggman appears and steals Birdie's emerald, dispatching Gamma to attack Sonic. Sonic damages Gamma, but Amy intervenes and asks Sonic to spares him. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, now with six Chaos Emeralds and his tail restored, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Big retrieves Froggy from inside Chaos before finding the Tornado II, and Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds; they both flee from the ship as it crashes. \n \nUpon erasing his master registration, Gamma resolves to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Gamma defeats him, but the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed, with Birdie's parents being released from within the two. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. Amy defeats the robot and sees Birdie and his family off, vowing to do her best. Elsewhere, Tails chases Eggman and stops him from detonating a missile in the middle of Station Square. Eggman resorts to using the Egg Walker to try and level the city, but is again defeated by Tails. Later, Sonic confronts the mad scientist in his Egg Viper and destroys it. \n \nA day following Eggman's defeats, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, draining the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a massive flood. The Chaos Emeralds are re-gathered by Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and the pink Flicky that fueled Gamma. They bring the emeralds to Sonic. \n \nTikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Instead, with the cheering of his friends and the people of Station Square, Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following his defeat, Chaos discovers that the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling his anger. United with Tikal, Chaos ascends into the heavens and disappears. The game ends with Sonic chasing after a fleeing Eggman.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","_id":"c41a04fe4a9a41a2a834c5a8e4df8ee1","name":"Sonic Adventure","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Sonic Adventure","id":"sdc57","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":7860,"gbId":7852,"gbGuid":"3030-7852","tgdbId":2416,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":7860,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/20/2001","total_rating":94,"esrb":"T","videos":["649rLYTO8oA","pPpkIitFjvk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21yv.jpg","description":"Super Smash Bros.

It's the first game of the series to be set on a group of islands in the sea. Therefore, many of Link's actions base on sailing and travelling from island to island, making a baton for controlling the wind the key item of the game.  Wind Waker is the first game of the Series with a cel-shaded graphic style. Since fans expected a Zelda game with realistic graphics like being shown at the Space World in 2000, the cel-shading look was critisized and discussed controversial for being too cartoonish.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:36 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:36 pm","_id":"41deb3298079427bb903b476863679d6","name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc80","name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":1033,"gbId":18508,"gbGuid":"3030-18508","tgdbId":174,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":1033,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"07/24/2003","total_rating":84,"esrb":"T","videos":["OYtN4poigAs","nD-fIAy2qxM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tjv.jpg","description":"The Future of Racing!  -Race for glory in the Grand Prix cups, speed through an incredible storyline as Captain Falcon, take on up to three friends, build and customize your own machine, challenge your time ghosts, and more! -Steer through danger with the Logitech Speed Force steering wheel, powered by force feedback technology (sold separately).  -Link to F-Zero AX  Take your memory card to the arcade and you can link to the upcoming F-Zero AX arcade game to race your custom machine, earn new parts, and unlock bonus features!","story":"The story starts out with Black Shadow driving down a highway after losing a Grand Prix. Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get. \n \nF-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off. \n \nFalcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil. \n \nAt his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:34 pm","_id":"0d78a523fa284c2e85dbeb33a9d7ecc6","name":"F-Zero GX","extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"ngc24","name":"F-Zero X","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3492,"gbId":20448,"gbGuid":"3030-20448","tgdbId":10836,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing"],"id":3492,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/01/2004","total_rating":74,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/quebpemarsck9hdl7qup.jpg","description":"Polarium mixes way-cool gameplay with an electronica soundtrack for the trippiest experience yet on the DS.

The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoring ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostreinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat. Driven either to possess or destroy it, they join a new journey, while Nightmare begins his rampage, seeking souls to restore Soul Edge once again.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":32,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":32,"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","_id":"1d30c988c7054c6fa9d83d2ad283ec7b","name":"SoulCalibur II","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"extraDataFull":[{"details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"name":"SoulCalibur II","igdbId":1565,"id":"xbox374","gbId":11822,"gbGuid":"3030-11822","tgdbId":4789,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"id":1565,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"02/21/2002","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":["Rf6naKIIuf0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e4p.jpg","description":"Jet Set Radio Future is a video game developed by Smilebit and is the sequel to Jet Set Radio.

In Fable, gamers decide: \"Who will I be?\"","story":"On his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned.

It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.  The game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Auditory"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:38 am","_id":"bdb83b0c8f5742a59793822c99182725","name":"Guitar Hero","extraData":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Guitar Hero","details":["Sony PlayStation 2 exclusive"],"id":"ps2202","igdbId":1285,"gbId":6311,"gbGuid":"3030-6311","tgdbId":7189,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sony Playstation 2","id":"ccl21","igdbId":8,"gbId":19,"gbGuid":"3045-19","tgdbId":11}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Music"],"id":1285,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 2","consoleId":8,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/25/2004","total_rating":92,"esrb":"M","videos":["vdlpWZpwOq0","XuUc08d7hyU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tgw.jpg","description":"Returning after his mother's murder to the semi-fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), Carl Johnson, a former gang banger, must take back the streets for his family and friends by gaining respect and once again gaining control over the streets.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each \"movie\" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.  New technology dubbed \"the AI Director\" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.  Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:31 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:31 am","_id":"087d51ad0177459c82a4ced2a91c11bd","name":"Left 4 Dead","extraData":["banned in Germany: Banned because of high-impact gory violence.
