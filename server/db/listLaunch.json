In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels. Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as \"ratigators.\" You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators. It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.","extraData":["Sega CD launch title","Sega CD launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Sewer Shark","id":"scd32","details":["Sega CD launch title"],"igdbId":4293,"gbId":7427,"gbGuid":"3030-7427","tgdbId":739,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega CD","id":"ccl15","igdbId":78,"gbId":29,"gbGuid":"3045-29","tgdbId":21}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]},{"name":"Sewer Shark","id":"scd32","details":["Sega CD launch title"],"igdbId":4293,"gbId":7427,"gbGuid":"3030-7427","tgdbId":739,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega CD","id":"ccl15","igdbId":78,"gbId":29,"gbGuid":"3045-29","tgdbId":21}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega CD","consoleId":78}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Lumines","id":4689,"genres":["Puzzle"],"total_rating":84,"total_rating_count":15,"first_release_date":"12/11/2004","developers":"","esrb":"","cover":{"id":77048,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ng8.jpg"},"platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":36,"name":"Xbox Live Arcade"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":45,"name":"PlayStation Network"},{"id":55,"name":"Mobile"}],"summary":"Lumines is a block-dropping game, that may seem at first to be similar to Columns and Tetris.
