This fear-fueled first-person shooter invites takes all the horror, chaos and tension found in the best of the horror genre and adds original interactive elements, including a unique death mechanic that puts players in the body of a different survivor each time they die, allowing them to track and take down their old, infected characters, recover their equipment and see if they can stay alive just a little bit longer this time.","story":"For the second time in history, a great plague has enveloped London in a fog of death. Big Ben tolls as hundreds upon thousands of the unprepared die or are infected by a sickness worse than death... \n \nYou are still breathing for now, but how long will you survive in the labyrinth of London streets and underground? The horrifying remains of humanity ravaged by the foul disease shuffle through the streets waiting to prey on your living flesh at every turn!","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"condition":"Excellent","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-10-05","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"10/05/2020 06:50 pm","updatedAt":"10/05/2020 06:50 pm","_id":"e1d697d7d0934f0ba7bf21cdc603fc71","name":"ZombiU","extraData":["Nintendo Wii U launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"wiiu439","name":"ZombiU","details":["Nintendo Wii U launch title"],"igdbId":1591,"gbId":35619,"gbGuid":"3030-35619","tgdbId":10709,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii U","id":"ccl6","igdbId":41,"gbId":139,"gbGuid":"3045-139","tgdbId":38}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"id":1591,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii U","consoleId":41,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-10-05","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Excellent","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"downstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/18/2006","total_rating":75,"esrb":"E","videos":["zqaPFAZS1K8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ufy.jpg","description":"Bowl like a pro or go for that home run...Experience Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing as you never did before.

This is also the only mode for which it's possible for a player to receive an infinite amount of points by playing, but the score display shall roll over at 10000.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"condition":"Excellent","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.87,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"10/04/2020 06:05 pm","updatedAt":"10/04/2020 06:05 pm","_id":"0647dfac080a419d96d5a33464de93d7","name":"Super Breakout","extraData":["Atari 5200 launch title","Atari 5200 4 player game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Breakout","id":"a528","details":["Atari 5200 launch title","Atari 5200 4 player game"],"igdbId":12321,"gbId":1055,"gbGuid":"3030-1055","tgdbId":5221,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Atari 5200","id":"ccl29","igdbId":66,"gbId":67,"gbGuid":"3045-67","tgdbId":26}],"special":[{"value":"Atari 5200 4 player game","forPlatform":{"name":"Atari 5200","id":"ccl29","igdbId":66,"gbId":67,"gbGuid":"3045-67","tgdbId":26}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Arcade"],"id":12321,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"physical":true,"pricePaid":4.87,"datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Excellent","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":1,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","physical","backwardComp"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"09/30/1979","total_rating":89,"videos":["85ZyE98Oi8k","e21nFQaoHMg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27k5.jpg","description":"Galaxian is a shooter arcade game developed by Namco in 1979.

The player controls a space ship in the bottom part of the screen and shoots at enemies descending from the top of the screen.   The game was received very well by the public and has continued to be a game with a competitive community to this day. It was followed by a successful sequel called Galaga in 1981 and two less known sequels called Gaplus in 1984 and Galaga '88 in 1987.

The game follows largely the same formula of its aforementioned predecessor, with Mario defeating enemies by jumping on them and collecting coins and power ups by hitting floating blocks, with each world leading up to a boss fight which is defeated using by collapsing the floor. A unique feature of this instalment is two scrolling shoot-'em-up levels, the first of which Mario pilots a submarine, and the second an aeroplane.","story":"Once upon a time, there was a peaceful world called Sarasaland.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. When part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. Occasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score.

It is more of a compilation of Tekken, Tekken 2, and Tekken 3, allowing players to use almost every character in the Tekken series. The only characters that did not return from previous games are the first King, Marshall Law, the first Jack robot, the first Kuma, Gon, and Doctor Boskonovitch (although Dr. Boskonovitch does make a cameo appearance in Tekken Bowl). \n \nTekken Tag Tournament also introduced two new characters, Tetsujin and Unknown. Tetsujin is a \"pallette swap\" for Mokujin. Unknown is the final boss of Tekken Tag Tournament. Both of these new characters are \"mimic\" characters.

It is the second game in the Soul series, preceded by Soul Edge (1996). Originally released in arcades in 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. In 1999 it was ported to the Dreamcast with improved graphics and new features. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is one of the most critically acclaimed fighting games of all time.","story":"The mystical sword of the legends, the \"Soul Edge\", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years, he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \"Evil Seed\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake. \n \nThree years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them, three sacred weapons join once again.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2018-12-27","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","notes":"","createdAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","updatedAt":"12/28/2018 06:31 am","_id":"3615c618feef470bbc8674bebb5226a3","name":"SoulCalibur","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"SoulCalibur","id":"sdc60","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":1564,"gbId":12411,"gbGuid":"3030-12411","tgdbId":7767,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Arcade"],"id":1564,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2018-12-27","howAcquired":"Retro Game Treasure","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/10/1989","total_rating":70,"esrb":"E","videos":["KMf-pNBCG_4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co231g.jpg","description":"In the darkest reaches of infinite space, pure evil lies in wait ...

Savagely intent upon rescuing Athena, daughter of Zeus, from the demon god Neff, you stalk the bowels of Hades and beyond.  What you are now you will not be. You are the Altered Beast - bestowed with five formidable forces of transformation - each more ferocious, more overwhelming, than the last. By battling, conquering and capturing spirit balls, your metamorphic powers will grow. But to what end?  The final confrontation. Your triumph over crocodile worms, hammer demons and grave masters brings on the horror of Neff himself. But boldness and cunning will be rewarded - in the ultimate Altered Beast!  Transformation is the ultimate power.","story":"A Roman centurion who had died in battle is resurrected from the dead by Zeus. The centurion is ordered by Zeus to save his daughter Athena from a Demon God called Neff in the Underworld. To become able to withstand the perils, the warrior gets the ability to absorb spirit balls which transform him into an Altered Beast, a part animal, part human creature of formidable force. Between each level are small animations giving the player glimpses of Athena's peril. He first travels through the graveyard fighting past zombies and winged demons. The centurion becomes a werewolf in order to fight Neff in the form of Aggar. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Underworld where he fights through giant leeches, Chinese dragon-headed rattlesnakes, and ferocious Chicken Stingers (resembling the ones from Golden Axe). The centurion turns into a humanoid thunder dragon in order to fight Neff in the form of Octeyes. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Cavern of Souls where he fights through Cave Needles (which resemble giant ants), turtle/snail hybrids, and zombies known as Grave Masters. The centurion turns into a humanoid bear in order to fight Neff in the form of Mouldy Snail. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion arrives at Neff's palace where he fights through zombies, Chicken Stingers, and Hammer Demons. The centurion turns into a humanoid tiger in order to fight Neff in the form of Crocodile Worm. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nAfter the centurion arrives in Dis, he fights through winged demons, Goat Men, Boar Men, saw fishes, and purple Unicorn Men to get to Neff. When the centurion confronts Neff, the centurion becomes a golden werewolf while Neff transforms into a Rhinoceros-Man. After he is defeated, a blue bird comes out of the ground and transforms back to Athena. Afterwards she is shown holding arms with her lycanthropic hero, thanking him for rescuing her. \nIn the original arcade, the end credits are interspersed with images of actors in costumes for the different characters and monsters of the game, implying the whole game was a film production.[2]","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","updatedAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","_id":"77c1cd2d3c9e4457869c528a33a0059f","name":"Altered Beast","extraData":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Altered Beast","id":"smd7","details":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"igdbId":2604,"gbId":2536,"gbGuid":"3030-2536","tgdbId":118,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"id":2604,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"09/19/2000","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","videos":["ADFhiXzBeRg","L7Q4lr4312o"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y77.jpg","description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game.

They must stop Doctor Eggman from stealing the seven Chaos Emeralds and feeding them to Chaos, a monster known as \"the God of Destruction\". The first in the Sonic the Hedgehog series to feature free-roaming 3D gameplay, Sonic Adventure features two game modes: Adventure and Trial. There are different goals for each character in the game: Sonic involves high speed gameplay, while Tails must reach the end of the level before Sonic does, and Knuckles searches the area for shards of the Master Emerald. Each of the three characters retain many of their trademark moves from previous Sonic games, such as Tails being able to fly for short periods of time, and Knuckles being able to glide through the air, though they can use updated techniques as well. The rest of the playable cast is rounded out by Amy, who must use her hammer to escape from Eggman's E-100 Zero robot chasing after her, Gamma, who must use its laser beam to shoot through levels to reach a target, and Big, who fishes in efforts to find his friend, Froggy.  The \"Adventure Mode\" is a one-player game which consists of two areas, the \"Adventure Field\" and an \"Action Stage\". The Adventure Field contains several \"Events\" that are encountered in the course of the story, while the Action Stages have each character fulfilling a goal to clear the stage. Players may also find hidden Chao Gardens, a protective environment inhabited by Chao, a sort of virtual pet. The player can hatch, raise and interact with a Chao. Chao can be taken with the player by downloading the minigame Chao Adventure to their VMU, or in the GameCube version, a Game Boy Advance with Sonic Advance or various other Game Boy Advance Sonic games. The player can also raise their stats by giving them small animals that they found by defeating the robots, which improves their performance in Chao Races. There are also eggs hidden throughout the Adventure Fields which can produce special types of Chao.  By playing through Action Stages and Subgames, searching through the Adventure Fields or winning Chao Races, players can earn Emblems. In the case of Action Stages, each one has three Emblems, which can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling certain objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.","story":"Sonic Adventure is set on Angel Island, an island floating above Earth. The Ancient Echidna Tribe's ruler, Pachacamac, plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe attack the shrine, attempting to use the emeralds for their own gain. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos and kills them. Following Chaos' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald. \n \nThree thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik shatters the Master Emerald and sets Chaos free. As a result, Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In the city of Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog battles Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles \"Tails\" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' Emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails resolve to search for the emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Eggman and Chaos. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, and shoots down Sonic and Tails' pursuing plane. \n \nEggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training. He orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos's tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy's owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird in possession of a Chaos Emerald and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie's location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdie and detains them both on the Egg Carrier, with Sonic and Tails using the Tornado II to follow them on board. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald. \n \nOn board the Egg Carrier, Eggman calls out the E-Series robots for their failure and removes them before stationing Gamma in Amy's cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt and Amy convinces Gamma that he should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship's deck. She meets up with Sonic and Tails, but Eggman appears and steals Birdie's emerald, dispatching Gamma to attack Sonic. Sonic damages Gamma, but Amy intervenes and asks Sonic to spares him. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, now with six Chaos Emeralds and his tail restored, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Big retrieves Froggy from inside Chaos before finding the Tornado II, and Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds; they both flee from the ship as it crashes. \n \nUpon erasing his master registration, Gamma resolves to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Gamma defeats him, but the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed, with Birdie's parents being released from within the two. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. Amy defeats the robot and sees Birdie and his family off, vowing to do her best. Elsewhere, Tails chases Eggman and stops him from detonating a missile in the middle of Station Square. Eggman resorts to using the Egg Walker to try and level the city, but is again defeated by Tails. Later, Sonic confronts the mad scientist in his Egg Viper and destroys it. \n \nA day following Eggman's defeats, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, draining the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a massive flood. The Chaos Emeralds are re-gathered by Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and the pink Flicky that fueled Gamma. They bring the emeralds to Sonic. \n \nTikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Instead, with the cheering of his friends and the people of Station Square, Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following his defeat, Chaos discovers that the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling his anger. United with Tikal, Chaos ascends into the heavens and disappears. The game ends with Sonic chasing after a fleeing Eggman.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 09:23 am","_id":"c41a04fe4a9a41a2a834c5a8e4df8ee1","name":"Sonic Adventure","extraData":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Sonic Adventure","id":"sdc57","details":["Sega Dreamcast launch title"],"igdbId":7860,"gbId":7852,"gbGuid":"3030-7852","tgdbId":2416,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Dreamcast","id":"ccl18","igdbId":23,"gbId":37,"gbGuid":"3045-37","tgdbId":16}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":7860,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Dreamcast","consoleId":23,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/20/1990","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E","videos":["BIe4AvKLSa4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y7v.jpg","description":"F-Zero is set in the year 2560, when humanity's multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth's social framework.
