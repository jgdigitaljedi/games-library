It is an exclusive version of Video Pinball produced by Sears and was programmed by Bob Smith. Arcade Pinball featured actual simulations of a pinball machine ball shooter, flippers, bumpers and spinners. The game also implemented a simulation of a real ball's actual physics. The game also features a unique rollover bonus with an Atari Inc. logo on the playfield; hitting the logo four times results in an extra ball. Most of the game play involves learning how to perform specific functions, such as launching the ball or activating the flippers, with the Atari 2600 joystick. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. The ball can be nudged (as in nudging a table gently in real life) by holding down the joystick button and moving the controller in a particular direction.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.87,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"10/04/2020 06:07 pm","updatedAt":"10/04/2020 06:07 pm","_id":"b56a651f351e4a97ab84a10a9afe4f2e","name":"Arcade Pinball","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade","Pinball"],"id":17247,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":4.87,"datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"09/17/2012","total_rating":83,"esrb":"M","videos":["8rmOUoBmChA","MCWJUSulnro","nicvyhrmTDs","qgcAq34Sifw","ERe3wZdIAtc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20tn.jpg","description":"Five years after the events of Borderlands, a valuable mineral called \"Eridium\" starts flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.","story":"The opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters as they ride a train on Pandora. However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. \nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. \nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. \nJack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. \nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. \nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen fades to black.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":4,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:01 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:01 am","_id":"12e817ba15be4eacbc81d53aa9d76d79","name":"Borderlands 2","genres":["Shooter","Role-playing (RPG)","FPS"],"id":1011,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":4,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"physical":true,"pricePaid":2,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleId":49,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox One"}],"physicalDigital":["digital","physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/27/2008","total_rating":28,"esrb":"E","videos":["UYMTIIXQtz8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rlhfawdw4aqulthnulvd.jpg","description":"Since it's inception, BIGFOOT has been the leader of the pack in innovation and development in the monster truck industry.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.  HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.  HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.  An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.  Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.  Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-07","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"PlayStation 4: PS Plus free game","createdAt":"03/20/2020 09:07 pm","updatedAt":"03/20/2020 09:07 pm","_id":"d7aadd7526524ff4a7fcf64639385f38","name":"HITMAN","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Tactical","Adventure"],"id":11157,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"physical":"","pricePaid":0,"datePurchased":"2019-02-07","howAcquired":"PSN","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":"PS Plus free game"},{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":0,"datePurchased":"2020-08-28","howAcquired":"Epic Games Store","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["digital","digital"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"08/26/2007","total_rating":88,"esrb":"T","videos":["lQLIwauAVNU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wwp.jpg","description":"Utilizing the unique powers of the Nintendo Wii system, Retro Studios once again takes us to the beyond with bounty Hunter Samus Aran.","story":"The Galactic Federation's Base Sector Zero is under attack by Space Pirates.

Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features.","story":"Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. \nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. \nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. \nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. \nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. \nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. \nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":8,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-10-01","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","updatedAt":"10/02/2020 05:59 am","_id":"4b4fd6f0f2544f65b08d3bebc24a31d5","name":"Battlefield 4","extraData":["banned in China: Banned for discrediting China's national image as well as threatening national security.

Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.1,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-09-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/18/2020 05:07 pm","updatedAt":"09/18/2020 05:07 pm","_id":"02c2460e36524aa4a21501131a0e42a9","name":"Pac-Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"id":2750,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"physical":true,"pricePaid":4.1,"datePurchased":"2020-09-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":2,"datePurchased":"2019-12-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Rough","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":49,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox One"},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1983","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pjwkp4cpasbtumli3p6a.jpg","description":"Chuck Norris Superkicks, is a 1983 video game produced by Xonox where the player takes control of Chuck Norris.

After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. \nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. \nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. \nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. \nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":null,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"02/01/2020 07:23 am","updatedAt":"02/01/2020 07:23 am","_id":"304d40e5da9c48cda42bfad3f8a4a969","name":"Half-Life 2","genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":233,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":6,"datePurchased":"2020-03-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["digital","physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"06/08/2011","total_rating":56,"esrb":"M","videos":["omOPjBoClw0","wVuuyRGB_BA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f1v.jpg","description":"Cocked, loaded and ready for action, Duke delivers epic ass-kicking, massive weapons, giant explosions and pure unadulterated fun!

Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities.

Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link's Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.  Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.  Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.  Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.  Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.  Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.  The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Fair","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:15 pm","_id":"256dd29f6bff442a829e4c71de2f22c0","name":"Link's Crossbow Training","extraData":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Link's Crossbow Training","details":["Nintendo Wii exclusive"],"id":"wii166","igdbId":4973,"gbId":1074,"gbGuid":"3030-1074","tgdbId":2248,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Wii","id":"ccl5","igdbId":5,"gbId":36,"gbGuid":"3045-36","tgdbId":9}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter"],"id":4973,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","condition":"Fair","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Wii U","consoleId":41}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/17/2011","total_rating":87,"esrb":"E10+","videos":["SMkvcKhVCEk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/crc3jclnlyzp90gdhmuc.jpg","description":"Skyward Sword is the sixteenth entry in the Legend of Zelda series.

The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release.  Crash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the sixth game in the main franchise, but it is the first in the Mutant series. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.  The game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","notes":"","createdAt":"11/19/2018 08:13 pm","updatedAt":"11/19/2018 08:13 pm","_id":"d7b70a07b2444024be2a5253bc008f9e","name":"Crash of the Titans","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":1190,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Wii","consoleId":5,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Lani","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Wii U","consoleId":41}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/06/2006","total_rating":73,"esrb":"","videos":["--pUVy5ByRU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wku.jpg","description":"Call of Duty 3 delivers the intensity of World War II combat closer than ever.

Featuring intense first-person action, vehicle combat, an expansive world and jaw-dropping graphics powered by id’s revolutionary idTech 5 technology. RAGE promises an experience like no other.","story":"On August 23, 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis collides with Earth, destroying human civilization and turning the world into a wasteland. Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde. \n \nIn 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind. \n \nRaine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead. \n \nIn Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants. \n \nWith the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":5,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-05-23","howAcquired":"Steam","notes":"","createdAt":"05/23/2020 07:17 am","updatedAt":"05/23/2020 07:17 am","_id":"efb2b65546c449f98fc16c99cec2d37a","name":"Rage","genres":["Shooter","Racing","FPS"],"id":509,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":5,"datePurchased":"2020-05-23","howAcquired":"Steam","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"physical":true,"pricePaid":2.5,"datePurchased":"2019-06-08","howAcquired":"GameStop","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleId":49,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox One"}],"physicalDigital":["digital","physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"05/25/2015","total_rating":67,"videos":["CNODcpGnxVY","-ehtQ5F4L_U","uvGbZamcaOQ","tLqkAFnm-c0","cDj6bjvDiY0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qrv.jpg","description":"The world’s most irreverent co-op action adventure returns!

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name.  Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer.  A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow.

Use both the touch screen to investigate the crime scenes, question witnesses and present shocking evidence. “Objection!”...It’s outrageous fun! You won’t be able to put down this laugh-out-loud, riveting adventure!","story":"The first case of the game presents defense attorney Phoenix Wright at his first trial under Mia Fey's watchful eye, successfully defending his childhood friend Larry Butz for murder. However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train. \nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema's scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.","player_perspectives":["First person","Side view","Text"],"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-03-06","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"03/07/2020 06:56 am","updatedAt":"03/07/2020 06:56 am","_id":"5c2cb4807515406faf6c31ef29715dcf","name":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Point-and-click","Puzzle","Adventure","Visual Novel"],"id":1426,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"physical":true,"pricePaid":20,"datePurchased":"2020-03-06","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo 3DS","consoleId":37}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"10/03/2004","total_rating":81,"esrb":"T","videos":["uU9w5yXAlj4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p3f.jpg","description":"You've been chosen by Tony Hawk to compete against Bam Margera's team in the World Destruction Tour.

A large purse of prize money which was to be awarded to the fighter who could defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round provided incentive for warriors from all over the globe. \n \nFinanced and sponsored by the giant financial groups, the Mishima Zaibatsu, the first Tekken tournament began with eight fighters, all of whom had emerged victorious in death matches held all over the world, all motivated by different motives, all possessing the skill and power to crumble mountains. \n \nMany battles were fought. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the title of King of the Iron Fist. \n \nThis warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's cold blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five. \n \nAfter a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the skills which had been passed down from generation to generation of the Mishima clan. \n \nAs Heihachi's broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knees and slowly lifted his father into his arms.

Techniques range from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.  There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.

A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.  Defender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":1,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/30/2019 08:02 am","updatedAt":"11/30/2019 08:02 am","_id":"d67858950b954ba59bdffdbc2a3e2404","name":"Defender","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Strategy","SHMUP"],"id":3873,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":1,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1979","videos":["whqjIxSEuBk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zb1dr05740jxndosbxqq.jpg","description":"The game is based on the game of bowling, playable by one player or two players alternating. In all six variations, games last for 10 frames, or turns. At the start of each frame, the current player is given two chances to roll a bowling ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down as many of the ten bowling pins as possible. The bowler (on the left side of the screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before releasing the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the pins. Knocking down every pin on the first shot is a strike, while knocking every pin down in both shots is a spare. The player's score is determined by the number of pins knocked down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":1,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/30/2019 08:01 am","updatedAt":"11/30/2019 08:01 am","_id":"8b043398ce9241b394f9f27c3d943d39","name":"Bowling","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Bowling"],"id":18005,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":1,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1986","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/oaxiecnlgzfkznslhtn7.jpg","description":"You're back in the wild west in this truly action packed, graphics intensive game.

McKenzie instructs Tanner to go to Miami and meet a pimp named Rufus. After arriving in Miami, Tanner uses his driving skills to prove himself to some gangsters in a parking garage, allowing him to become their getaway driver. \n \nTanner carries out jobs for various gangsters before meeting Rufus, who tasks Tanner with rescuing Jean-Paul, one of Rufus's associates. Rufus is later shot by his girlfriend Jesse. Needing more information for his investigation, Tanner apprehends Jesse and takes her to the police station, where she reveals that Jean-Paul is now in San Francisco. \n \nTanner goes to San Francisco, where he meets Castaldi, Jean-Paul's boss, and begins working directly for him. He also meets Rusty Slater, his former racing rival, who also works for Castaldi. Tanner later learns that Castaldi is working with a man named Don Hancock, who is running for president. He later suspects that Slater has been spying on him and wrecks Slater's car during a road chase, resulting in Slater being arrested. \n \nThe Castaldi family move to Los Angeles, where Castaldi plans to assassinate FBI agent Bill Maddox as part of Castaldi's plan to carry out a more high-profile assassination in New York. Tanner tells Leck, a police associate, to ensure Maddox turns up, otherwise Tanner's cover may be affected. The assassination on Maddox is successful, but the police ambush the gangsters, forcing Tanner to take them to safety. Tanner convinces the suspicious gangsters that Slater likely told the police about the planned assassination while under interrogation. Leck later tells Tanner that McKenzie recently met Marcus Vaughn, a corrupt FBI agent who is working with Castaldi and Hancock. \n \nThe Castaldi family then move to New York, the location of the planned high-profile assassination. Tanner is told by his police associates that McKenzie wants him to pull out of the undercover operation, as he is worried that Tanner's cover will not hold up much longer, and Leck tells Tanner that Hancock has bribed several members of the FBI. Tanner remains undercover and continues working for Castaldi, intent on discovering what he is planning. \n \nTanner eventually learns that Castaldi plans to assassinate the President of the United States, and Tanner is tasked with driving the President's car. However, he ignores all instructions and takes the President to safety. McKenzie then arrives and tells Tanner that Castaldi and all of his associates, including Hancock and Vaughn, have been arrested. He then tells Tanner to take his badge back, but Tanner refuses, suspecting that the police and FBI are involved in the job, corrupted by bribes due to Vaughn's involvement. Tanner leaves, ignoring McKenzie completely.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-11-06","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"11/10/2019 06:39 am","updatedAt":"11/10/2019 06:39 am","_id":"013bba790c434a909821d07897668cf2","name":"Driver","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator"],"id":675,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2019-11-06","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 2","consoleId":8},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 3","consoleId":9}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"04/17/2005","total_rating":80,"esrb":"M","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rwx.jpg","description":"Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict enhances both single and multiplayer gameplay, including all-new player acrobatics, third-person camera mode, vehicles, and intense melee abilities.

In several fights the player will meet a lot of people but at the same time a Darkus user, whose name is Marduk, decides to rule over all Bakugan together with Vladitor, another Bakugan that suddenly appears.  Right after Naga got the Silent Core, the seals that held Vladitor captive in the Doom Dimension suddenly broke and he escaped from the Doom Dimension. At the end of a tournament when Dan makes the player an official Bakugan Battle Brawler, Marduk is revealed to have allied with Hal G, Masquerade and Naga in order to defeat the Battle Brawlers and rule over the worlds and the Bakugan. The player must win the Ultimate Battle Tournament, defeating also Dan, Runo, Marucho, Julie, Shun, Masquerade, and a 1-on-1 showdown with Omega Leonidas and Battle Axe Vladitor.

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. \n \nGeralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad. \n \nArriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages. \n \nAfter sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship. \n \nThe pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir. \n \nCiri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. \n \nThe ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org, only main game]","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":16,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-09-01","howAcquired":"PSN","notes":"","createdAt":"02/22/2020 05:52 am","updatedAt":"02/22/2020 05:52 am","_id":"b8af43e6694d4d3da808654e301a8a05","name":"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year Edition","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":22439,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48,"physical":"","pricePaid":16,"datePurchased":"2019-09-01","howAcquired":"PSN","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"Steam","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["digital","digital"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"03/01/2006","total_rating":69,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xbgroe3gpa4ov7cqy3uw.jpg","description":"This installment of the series takes place in the world of Fa'diel on the island of Illusia where, at the center of the island, stands the famous Tree of Mana.

It was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. Toshiaki Mori provided promotional artwork during the release of the game, including cover art.Deadly Silence includes a \"Classic Mode\", the original game with minimal enhancements and touch-screen support, and a \"Rebirth Mode\", containing a greater number of enemies and a series of new puzzles that make use of the platform's specifications.The game makes use of the dual screen display with the top screen used to display the map, along with the player's remaining ammunition and health (determined by the color of the background); while the bottom screen displays the main action, and can be switched to show the player's inventory. The DS version also includes updated play mechanics: the 180-degree turn introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, along with the knife button and tactical reload from Resident Evil 4. The updated controls are applicable to both Classic and Rebirth modes. Dialog and loading screens can now be skipped. The live-action footage was still censored, even in the game's Japanese release; however, the scene showing Kenneth's decapitated head was kept.In \"Rebirth\", new puzzles are added that use the system's touch-screen. \"Knife Battle\" sequences, viewed from a first-person perspective, are also added, in which the player must fend off incoming enemies by swinging the knife via the stylus. One particular puzzle requires the player to resuscitate an injured comrade by blowing into the built-in microphone. The player can also shake off enemies by using the touch screen, performing a melee attack.The game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes. The first is a cooperative mode in which each player must help each other solve puzzles and escape the mansion together. The other is a competitive mode in which the objective is to get the highest score out of all the players by destroying the most monsters, with the tougher monsters being worth more points. There are three playable multiplayer stages and nine playable characters.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":40,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-07-28","howAcquired":"Classic Game Fest","notes":"","createdAt":"07/28/2019 04:42 pm","updatedAt":"07/28/2019 04:42 pm","_id":"beb12075474742d88b0cad753b5c000c","name":"Resident Evil: Deadly Silence","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"id":20456,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo DS","consoleId":20,"physical":true,"pricePaid":40,"datePurchased":"2019-07-28","howAcquired":"Classic Game Fest","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo 3DS","consoleId":37}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/12/2006","total_rating":75,"esrb":"E","videos":["bQDvtHBc-54"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29s5.jpg","description":"A mysterious floating island has suddenly appeared over peaceful Yoshi’s Island.

As the story progresses, the situation escalates and Cloud and his allies face Sephiroth, the game's main antagonist.","story":"The game begins with Cloud Strife, working as a mercenary for hire, helping the eco terrorist group AVALANCHE in a raid against the Mako reactors surrounding the Shinra-governed city of Midgar. Barret, the group's leader, believes the Mako energy the reactors consume to be the planet's lifeblood, and Shinra's reactors are killing the planet. Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa, is also in the group. Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is ambushed at the next reactor during a subsequent raid. When the reactor explodes, Cloud drops down into Midgar's slums. He is found by Aerith (aka Aeris), a girl he briefly met selling flowers after his first mission with AVALANCHE. Prompted by the arrival of the Turks, who have been sent to capture Aerith, Cloud agrees to act as her bodyguard and defends her from their assault. Meanwhile, Shinra learns the location of AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7, and subsequently destroys it by dropping the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums, killing its population. The Turks also capture Aerith, who is revealed to be the last surviving \"Cetra\", an ancient near-dead tribe closely attuned with the planet. President Shinra and Professor Hojo believe Aerith is the key to finding the \"Promised Land\", a mythical land of fertility they see as an abundant source of Mako. The remaining AVALANCHE members - Cloud, Barret and Tifa - infiltrate Shinra to rescue Aerith, in the process encountering a specimen simply labeled \"Jenova\". Joined by Red XIII, a sentient tiger-like creature on whom Hojo had been conducting experiments, the party rescues Aerith, but is captured by the Turks while trying to escape and detained within the building. In the morning, they find their cells open and most of the personnel, including President Shinra, killed: the perpetrator appears to be Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER leader who was presumed dead several years ago.The group discovers that the Jenova specimen is also missing, presumed stolen by Sephiroth. \n \nWhile the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, the party leaves Midgar and pursues Sephiroth across the planet. They are joined by Cait Sith, a cat-robot secretly controlled by repentant Turk Reeve Tuesti; Yuffie Kisaragi, a teenage ninja from Wutai; Vincent Valentine, a former Turk; and Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking pilot. At a Cetra temple, the party encounters Sephiroth, who reveals his plan: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream, made of pure Mako energy, will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use the legendary Black Materia to cast a spell called \"Meteor\" to cause a massive injury, enabling him to merge with the planet's Mako energy and be reborn as a god. The party drives off Sephiroth, acquiring the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the Materia. While the party recovers from the encounter, Aerith sets off to stop Sephiroth on her own, following him to an ancient Cetra city. The party follows, and finds Aerith praying to the planet for aid. Just as they reach her, Sephiroth kills her. Cloud and his allies track Sephiroth to the North Crater. During their journey, they find out that Jenova is an interstellar creature who crashed on the planet roughly two thousand years ago, intent on taking over completely. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called Weapons. While most humans fled, the Cetra managed to defeat Jenova and entomb its remains. A few decades before the present, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by Professor Gast, a researcher for Shinra. Mistaking Jenova for a Cetra, Gast attempted to clone Jenova, assisted by Hojo. Even though Gast abandoned the project, Hojo successfully managed to use his assistant's unborn child for the experiment: the baby was Sephiroth. Approximately five years before the present day, while on a Shinra mission with Cloud to Cloud's and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, Sephiroth encountered Hojo's failed test subjects and learned of his origins. Mistakenly believing that Jenova and he were Cetra, he was driven insane and destroyed Nibelheim as an act of vengeance on the normal human population. Cloud and Tifa confronted Sephiroth during the massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished, presumed dead until his reappearance in the present day. \n \nWhen the party reaches the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth for killing Aerith, they learn that Sephiroth was one of multiple Jenova clones that Hojo had created from both animals and humans. Upon reaching Sephiroth, who has been killing and absorbing the Jenova clones to instigate a \"Reunion\" of Jenova's cells, he manipulates Cloud into helping him cast Meteor, then states that Cloud is one of Sephiroth's clones, showing him memories of the Nibelheim incident with a black-haired SOLDIER in Cloud's place. The summoning of Meteor activates the planet's Weapons, and during the subsequent earthquake, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream. The rest of the party and the Turks that had followed them to the Crater escape on the airship, the Highwind, where the party members are placed under arrest. As Meteor approaches the planet, the Weapons turn on humanity in an attempt to return as much Mako energy to the Lifestream as possible to aid the planet. Shinra focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the Weapons and attempting to destroy Meteor directly, which eventually costs the lives of the majority of Shinra's personnel.[31] Tifa, Barret and the others are sentenced to be executed, but escape. They find a catatonic Cloud at a hospital in a tropical resort, where he washed up following the events at the North Crater. Tifa stays behind to help Cloud recover, while the rest of the party continue their fight against Shinra. An attack by the Weapons destroys the island, and Cloud and Tifa both fall into the Lifestream. There, Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories and learns the truth about his past. \n \nIt is revealed that Cloud was not accepted into SOLDIER, and that the SOLDIER in Sephiroth's visions was Aerith's first love and Cloud's friend, Zack Fair. The two were present during the Nibelheim incident, with Cloud managing to fatally wound Sephiroth, who only survived through Jenova's cells: Zack and Cloud were severely wounded and later taken and used by Hojo to perfect his SOLDIER and Jenova experiments. Zack tried escaping with Cloud but was killed by Shinra soldiers. Cloud recovered, took Zack's sword and made his way to Midgar: Cloud's own aspirations to SOLDIER and Zack's memories and stories combined, with the help of the Jenova treatment, to create a false personality. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud is able to recover. After Cloud and Tifa emerge from the Lifestream, the party regroup and learn that Aerith, in her final moments, was attempting to use the White Materia to cast the spell \"Holy\", the only means of opposing Meteor. It turns out she was successful in casting the spell, but Sephiroth has been preventing its release. The group decide to first stop the rampage of the Weapons. Alongside this, the party confront Hojo, revealed to be Sephiroth's father, as the scientist attempts to aid his son by feeding Mako energy to him. After mutating himself with Jenova cells, he is killed in combat. After this, they launch their final assault on Sephiroth, who is defeated by Cloud after a series of battles. The party escapes from the crater as Holy is released. Holy attempts to block Meteor under Midgar, but Meteor has drawn too close for Holy to combat it alone. Just before Meteor's impact, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":35,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-05-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"05/18/2019 03:29 pm","updatedAt":"05/18/2019 03:29 pm","_id":"154e749a921a45579c1086c3d8c5dbec","name":"Final Fantasy VII","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":427,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation","consoleId":7,"physical":true,"pricePaid":35,"datePurchased":"2019-05-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 2","consoleId":8},{"consoleName":"Sony PlayStation 3","consoleId":9}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"06/05/1993","total_rating":83,"esrb":"E","videos":["E0ErE4l1EKM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1nqz.jpg","description":"A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!  Nintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening. Link's newest challenge is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide. As a castaway, Link must find a way to escape from the island and return to his beloved homeland of Hyrule.  But it won't be as easy as chartering a boat. The island's inhabitants have no knowledge of the outside world. One creature, a talking Owl, may know the solution to Link's dilemma, but first Link must tackle eight dungeons full of treacherous monsters and tricky taps. His goal: find the eight Instruments of the Sirens and awaken the omnipotent Wind Fish which rules the island.  Link will battle new enemies and make new friends in one of the most in-depth fantasy adventures for Game Boy yet!  A battery-backed memory will save up to three games so you never have to start your journey empty-handed.","story":"After the events of A Link to the Past, the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats. A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint Island where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would leave and travel across the sea. After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens. \n \nLink proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish. After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld. \n \nAfter collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish. This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past.[24] Its final transformation is \"DethI\", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow. After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream. When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear. Link finds himself lying on his ship's driftwood in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-05-03","howAcquired":"eBay","notes":"","createdAt":"05/05/2019 07:31 pm","updatedAt":"05/05/2019 07:31 pm","_id":"e481fcd0ad244b68b028fadc1869b4e3","name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure"],"id":1028,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"physical":true,"pricePaid":20,"datePurchased":"2019-05-03","howAcquired":"eBay","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24},{"consoleName":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","consoleId":22},{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube (Game Boy Player)","consoleId":21}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"10/24/2002","esrb":"E","videos":["XOoVZEd-tC8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tc0.jpg","description":"Relive the birth of handheld gaming with over a dozen classic Game & Watch games.

When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.  • Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.  • As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.","story":"The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.  The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-16","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","_id":"b7cac09307d44165bad3fe268744f7dc","name":"Crackdown 2","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","story":"Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three crime organizations: Los Muertos (which means \"the dead\" in Spanish), of Central American origin; an Eastern European gang, the Volk (Russian for Wolf) ; and the formerly above-board Shai-Gen Corporation, from East Asia. Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \"the Agency\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \"Agents\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. \nThroughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders and subordinates of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-06","howAcquired":"XBOX Store","notes":"Xbox 360: Free to celebrate Crackdown 3 coming out soon","createdAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","updatedAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","_id":"d5ea00afab3c47c7b234fc4bf8c31d4e","name":"Crackdown","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past revives the classic SNES game on the Game Boy Advance and adds a new multiplayer mode. In a Link to the Past, Link travels between the light world and the dark world, conquering fierce monsters and uncovering Hyrule's deepest secrets along the way. Also included is Four Swords, which lets you play with up to three other players, slashing through dungeons and collecting rupees. Whether you choose solo or competitive play, The Legend of Zelda will keep you occupied with its brain-bending puzzles and fun swashbuckling action.","story":"In A Link to the Past \nThe intro to A Link to the Past reveals the back story of the game, showing that series antagonist Ganon was sealed away after his bid for the Triforce. However, the seal has grown weak, and a wizard named Agahnim has taken over the throne of Hyrule, and is kidnapping the seven descendants of the Sages who sealed away Ganon, which includes Princess Zelda. The game opens with series protagonist Link receiving a message from Zelda, telling him to come save her. Following his Uncle, he finds him near death, and is tasked by his Uncle to find and rescue Zelda, giving him his sword and shield before dying. After Link reaches the dungeons, he frees Zelda from her cage, and takes her through a hidden sewer into a Sanctuary, where she remains hidden. The man in the Sanctuary tells Link of Agahnim's plan to break the seal the Sages placed, requiring Link to obtain the Master Sword. Link travels across Hyrule, aided by a man named Sahasrahla, collecting three pendants from the three dungeons, using them to unseal the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. Link returns to Hyrule Castle with the Master Sword after Zelda is kidnapped. When he meets Agahnim, he finds that he is too late, as Agahnim teleports her away. \n \nAfter battling and defeating Agahnim, he takes Link into the Sacred Realm, which has been corrupted and transformed into the Dark World by Ganon. He is tasked with rescuing the seven Maidens who have been sealed away in crystals, as well as finding magical items called the Silver Arrows. Link eventually rescues Zelda, and uses the Maidens' power to break into Ganon's Tower. After fighting and defeating Agahnim for the second time, Ganon flies from Agahnim's corpse into the Pyramid of Power. Link follows, doing battle with him. He eventually defeats Ganon, and finds the Triforce. After the Triforce speaks to Link, Link uses it to wish for Hyrule to return to normal. Afterward, he returns the Master Sword to where he found it. If the player has completed Four Swords, they may find an alternate ending by beating a secret dungeon. This dungeon features four Dark Links, in reference to the four Links in the Four Swords game. After defeating them, an ending showing the inhabitants of the Dark World and the various bosses is shown. \n \nIn Four Swords \nTaking place before the events of Ocarina of Time, the prologue shows Link and Zelda approaching a sword in a pedestal, called the Four Sword. After Zelda explains its history and the creature sealed within it, the creature named Vaati breaks free, capturing Zelda to marry her. Link is encountered by three fairies who instruct Link to pull the Four Sword out. Link pulls the Four Sword out, inadvertently creating three copies of himself that fight alongside him. As the game begins, the four Links are tasked with finding four Great Fairies, who together will grant them access to Vaati's palace. After finding the four Great Fairies and entering the palace the Links battle Vaati. After Vaati is thoroughly weakened, he is trapped in the Four Sword. Zelda and Link return the Four Sword back in its pedestal.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","notes":"","createdAt":"11/21/2018 03:29 pm","updatedAt":"11/21/2018 03:29 pm","_id":"54d72568c2824bf0b503028535c4e63e","name":"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":[],"id":77336,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"bought from Solis","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Nintendo DS Lite","consoleId":20},{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube (Game Boy Player)","consoleId":21}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":true},{"first_release_date":"11/20/1994","total_rating":82,"esrb":"E","videos":["bXHDSA35_2k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29n6.jpg","description":"Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rareware in 1994.

The game borrows elements from the original Sonic the Hedgehog titles for the Sega Genesis, but with the post-Dreamcast artstyle for the characters which was introduced in Sonic Adventure. The game also includes multiplayer features and mini-games.  The title was also ported to the Nokia N-Gage under the title \"SonicN\".","story":"The game follows Sonic and his friends as they travel through various zones in order to stop Dr. Eggman from taking over South Island. The game features four playable characters; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Each character has the same moveset as they did in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, with the addition of a melee attack. Each character has a special ability, such as Sonic's splice shield, Tails' flight and Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities. In her playable 2D debut, Amy cannot perform the Spin Dash or get into ball form when jumping like the others, and must rely on her Piko Piko Hammer to defend herself, making her unique amongst the characters. Grind rails first introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 also make their first 2D appearance. Sonic and Tails can also be used at the same time during the story by inputting a cheat code at the character selection screen.

Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all. \n \nOnce the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World. \n \nThe Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered.

The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoring ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostreinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat. Driven either to possess or destroy it, they join a new journey, while Nightmare begins his rampage, seeking souls to restore Soul Edge once again.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":32,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":32,"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","_id":"1d30c988c7054c6fa9d83d2ad283ec7b","name":"SoulCalibur II","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"extraDataFull":[{"details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"name":"SoulCalibur II","igdbId":1565,"id":"xbox374","gbId":11822,"gbGuid":"3030-11822","tgdbId":4789,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"id":1565,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"02/21/2002","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":["Rf6naKIIuf0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e4p.jpg","description":"Jet Set Radio Future is a video game developed by Smilebit and is the sequel to Jet Set Radio.

However, the college's team name is a running gag because it is obscured by objects, only revealing it as Flaming Fa-. The final scene shows the team name is actually the Flaming Fantasticks after the Swingles van leaves the school.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Fair","case":"custom","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:54 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:54 pm","_id":"05a3944dafd24b35a61cbe26f9788002","name":"Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Incorrect textures are loaded as the player progresses"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":2913,"name":"Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Incorrect textures are loaded as the player progresses"],"id":"xbox210","gbId":17050,"gbGuid":"3030-17050","tgdbId":4856,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Incorrect textures are loaded as the player progresses","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Point-and-click","Simulator","Adventure"],"id":2913,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"},{"consoleName":"PC (Microsoft Windows)","consoleId":6,"physical":"","pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Other","case":"none","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp","digital"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/08/2004","total_rating":82,"esrb":"M","videos":["fkCgDIhUJmQ","XFKoLeOXEDc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1x77.jpg","description":"Halo 2 is the sequel to the highly successful and critically acclaimed Halo: Combat Evolved.

Life stories are created from childhood through adulthood and on to old age. Players may choose the paths of righteousness or dedicate their characters' lives to evil; observing as they transform into reflections of their actions and decisions. As players' characters develop, the world reacts to them and their actions. People comment on their successes, failures, appearances and behaviors. Their many opinions are expressed through applause, mockery, trepidation, panic and even flirtation. With each person characters aid and every creature they slay, the world is changed forever. In Fable, gamers decide: \"Who will I be?\"","story":"On his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","_id":"1f234ccd0f274ddca7c5623d586d230e","name":"Fable","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":521,"name":"Fable","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"id":"xbox131","gbId":3264,"gbGuid":"3030-3264","tgdbId":6055,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":521,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/20/2003","total_rating":88,"esrb":"T","videos":["O1ZPN-uiBIY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g8e.jpg","description":"Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge combines thrilling aerial combat with the swashbuckling style of a Hollywood action-adventure movie.
