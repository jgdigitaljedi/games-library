Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Take on the role of one of six powerful character classes -- Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, Wizard, or the all-new Crusader -- and embark on a dark journey through Acts I-V to save the world of Sanctuary from ancient and sinister forces. Players will acquire powerful items, spells, and abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"PlayStation 4","consoleId":48}]},{"igdb":{"name":"Rayman Legends","id":1968,"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"total_rating":89,"total_rating_count":247,"first_release_date":"08/29/2013","developers":"","esrb":"E10+","alternative_names":[{"id":13162,"name":"Rayman: Legends"},{"id":13163,"name":"Rayman Legends Definitive Edition"}],"cover":{"id":84979,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1tkj.jpg"},"franchise":{"id":994,"name":"Rayman"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"id":871,"offlinecoopmax":5,"offlinemax":0},{"id":7470},{"id":8221,"offlinecoopmax":0,"offlinemax":4}],"platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"summary":"The Glade of Dreams is in trouble once again!
