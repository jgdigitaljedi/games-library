You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":5.48,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-09-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/18/2020 05:08 pm","updatedAt":"09/18/2020 05:08 pm","_id":"2454a0232cd343b596a96afee150a338","name":"James 'Buster' Douglas Knock Out Boxing","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd121","name":"James 'Buster' Douglas Knock Out Boxing","igdbId":46530,"gbId":5261,"gbGuid":"3030-5261","tgdbId":null,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Sport","Boxing"],"id":46530,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":"","pricePaid":5.48,"datePurchased":"2020-09-18","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["digital"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"06/11/1984","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E10+","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/j0f9nzihocbdhcdcov36.jpg","description":"Hogan's Alley (ホーガンズアレイ Hōganzu Arei) is a 1984 video game by Nintendo.

This is also the only mode for which it's possible for a player to receive an infinite amount of points by playing, but the score display shall roll over at 10000.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"condition":"Excellent","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.87,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"10/04/2020 06:05 pm","updatedAt":"10/04/2020 06:05 pm","_id":"0647dfac080a419d96d5a33464de93d7","name":"Super Breakout","extraData":["Atari 5200 launch title","Atari 5200 4 player game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Super Breakout","id":"a528","details":["Atari 5200 launch title","Atari 5200 4 player game"],"igdbId":12321,"gbId":1055,"gbGuid":"3030-1055","tgdbId":5221,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Atari 5200","id":"ccl29","igdbId":66,"gbId":67,"gbGuid":"3045-67","tgdbId":26}],"special":[{"value":"Atari 5200 4 player game","forPlatform":{"name":"Atari 5200","id":"ccl29","igdbId":66,"gbId":67,"gbGuid":"3045-67","tgdbId":26}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Arcade"],"id":12321,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Atari 5200","consoleId":66,"physical":true,"pricePaid":4.87,"datePurchased":"2020-10-04","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Excellent","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 2600","consoleId":59,"physical":true,"pricePaid":1,"datePurchased":"2019-11-28","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Fair","case":"custom","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleName":"Atari 7800","consoleId":60}],"physicalDigital":["physical","physical","backwardComp"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","total_rating":68,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2do7.jpg","description":"NBA JAM Tournament Edition brings you more senses-shattering slam dunking excitement than ever!

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":29.41,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-09-12","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","updatedAt":"09/12/2020 05:02 pm","_id":"db24c073581847fd992221cd2a99fdca","name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"id":5565,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":29.41,"datePurchased":"2020-09-12","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"11/30/1983","total_rating":47,"esrb":"E","videos":["zlNqtY76ho0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/z6xrk4qkqerfdrvsgkin.jpg","description":"The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling.

Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer.  A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2020-05-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","notes":"","createdAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","updatedAt":"05/08/2020 06:39 am","_id":"7bfda36d16354cf6943e1c53cc0d3b23","name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":47321,"name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360"],"id":"xbox452","gbId":17491,"gbGuid":"3030-17491","tgdbId":8037,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Shooter","FPS"],"id":47321,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"2020-05-07","howAcquired":"Video Games Monthly","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/03/2004","total_rating":74,"esrb":"M","videos":["vK4mreqtSXo"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ky.jpg","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deception is the sixth installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.  Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.  The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.  At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).  When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":20,"physical":true,"cib":true,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis: original release without \"Not for resale\"","createdAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","updatedAt":"11/15/2019 01:07 pm","_id":"d0a1f25adb5443fa8ea0eeab5c953b1d","name":"Sonic the Hedgehog","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd217","name":"Sonic The Hedgehog","igdbId":3192,"gbId":2465,"gbGuid":"3030-2465","tgdbId":40416,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"id":3192,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":20,"datePurchased":"2019-11-15","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":true,"notes":"original release without \"Not for resale\""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"03/03/2008","total_rating":68,"esrb":"M","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vcwjaimr3yjtt09wkymx.jpg","description":"Army Of Two throws gamers into hot spots ripped from current day headlines where they will utilize unique two-man strategies and tactics while seamlessly transitioning between playing with intelligent Partner AI (PAI) and a live player.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.  The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Good","case":"custom","pricePaid":4.5,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-16","howAcquired":"GameStop","notes":"","createdAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","updatedAt":"02/16/2019 12:11 pm","_id":"b7cac09307d44165bad3fe268744f7dc","name":"Crackdown 2","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","story":"Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three crime organizations: Los Muertos (which means \"the dead\" in Spanish), of Central American origin; an Eastern European gang, the Volk (Russian for Wolf) ; and the formerly above-board Shai-Gen Corporation, from East Asia. Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \"the Agency\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \"Agents\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. \nThroughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders and subordinates of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Xbox 360","consoleId":12,"condition":"Other","case":"none","pricePaid":0,"physical":"","cib":"","datePurchased":"2019-02-06","howAcquired":"XBOX Store","notes":"Xbox 360: Free to celebrate Crackdown 3 coming out soon","createdAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","updatedAt":"02/07/2019 09:25 pm","_id":"d5ea00afab3c47c7b234fc4bf8c31d4e","name":"Crackdown","extraData":["Microsoft Xbox 360 full exclusive","Xbox 360 game backward compatible with Xbox One","banned in Germany: Originally banned because of high-impact gory violence.

To become able to withstand the perils, the warrior gets the ability to absorb spirit balls which transform him into an Altered Beast, a part animal, part human creature of formidable force. Between each level are small animations giving the player glimpses of Athena's peril. He first travels through the graveyard fighting past zombies and winged demons. The centurion becomes a werewolf in order to fight Neff in the form of Aggar. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Underworld where he fights through giant leeches, Chinese dragon-headed rattlesnakes, and ferocious Chicken Stingers (resembling the ones from Golden Axe). The centurion turns into a humanoid thunder dragon in order to fight Neff in the form of Octeyes. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Cavern of Souls where he fights through Cave Needles (which resemble giant ants), turtle/snail hybrids, and zombies known as Grave Masters. The centurion turns into a humanoid bear in order to fight Neff in the form of Mouldy Snail. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion arrives at Neff's palace where he fights through zombies, Chicken Stingers, and Hammer Demons. The centurion turns into a humanoid tiger in order to fight Neff in the form of Crocodile Worm. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nAfter the centurion arrives in Dis, he fights through winged demons, Goat Men, Boar Men, saw fishes, and purple Unicorn Men to get to Neff. When the centurion confronts Neff, the centurion becomes a golden werewolf while Neff transforms into a Rhinoceros-Man. After he is defeated, a blue bird comes out of the ground and transforms back to Athena. Afterwards she is shown holding arms with her lycanthropic hero, thanking him for rescuing her. \nIn the original arcade, the end credits are interspersed with images of actors in costumes for the different characters and monsters of the game, implying the whole game was a film production.[2]","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","updatedAt":"11/16/2018 07:44 pm","_id":"77c1cd2d3c9e4457869c528a33a0059f","name":"Altered Beast","extraData":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Altered Beast","id":"smd7","details":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"igdbId":2604,"gbId":2536,"gbGuid":"3030-2536","tgdbId":118,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"id":2604,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""}],"physicalDigital":["physical"],"location":"upstairs","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"09/12/1985","total_rating":84,"esrb":"E","videos":["FVatG--faZI","sSgTB-tKrNk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2362.jpg","description":"A side scrolling 2D platformer and first entry in the Super Mario franchise, Super Mario Bros. follows Italian plumber Mario as he treks across many levels of platforming challenges featuring hostile enemies to rescue Princess Peach from the evil king Bowser.","story":"One day, the Mushroom Kingdom was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles capable of using powerful dark magic.

The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoring ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostreinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat. Driven either to possess or destroy it, they join a new journey, while Nightmare begins his rampage, seeking souls to restore Soul Edge once again.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":32,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":32,"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:56 pm","_id":"1d30c988c7054c6fa9d83d2ad283ec7b","name":"SoulCalibur II","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"extraDataFull":[{"details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work"],"name":"SoulCalibur II","igdbId":1565,"id":"xbox374","gbId":11822,"gbGuid":"3030-11822","tgdbId":4789,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - The controller vibration does not work","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"id":1565,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"02/21/2002","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","videos":["Rf6naKIIuf0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e4p.jpg","description":"Jet Set Radio Future is a video game developed by Smilebit and is the sequel to Jet Set Radio.

An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"condition":"Good","case":"original","pricePaid":null,"physical":true,"cib":"","datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","notes":"","createdAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","updatedAt":"11/18/2018 03:51 pm","_id":"1f234ccd0f274ddca7c5623d586d230e","name":"Fable","extraData":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"extraDataFull":[{"igdbId":521,"name":"Fable","details":["Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound"],"id":"xbox131","gbId":3264,"gbGuid":"3030-3264","tgdbId":6055,"special":[{"value":"Xbox game plays on Xbox 360 - Occasionally there is an audio \"scratch\" or static popping sound","forPlatform":{"name":"Microsoft Xbox","id":"ccl25","igdbId":11,"gbId":32,"gbGuid":"3045-32","tgdbId":14}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"id":521,"compilation":null,"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Xbox","consoleId":11,"physical":true,"pricePaid":null,"datePurchased":"","howAcquired":"GameOver","condition":"Good","case":"original","cib":"","notes":""},{"consoleId":12,"consoleName":"Microsoft Xbox 360"}],"physicalDigital":["physical","backwardComp"],"location":"both","handheld":false},{"first_release_date":"10/20/2003","total_rating":88,"esrb":"T","videos":["O1ZPN-uiBIY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g8e.jpg","description":"Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge combines thrilling aerial combat with the swashbuckling style of a Hollywood action-adventure movie.
