The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...  The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100000,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure"},{"id":1644,"name":"James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing","first_release_date":"11/16/2003","total_rating":77,"esrb":"T","genres":["Shooter","Sport","Adventure"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21s1.jpg","description":"Returning as James Bond is Pierce Brosnan, who will lend his cyberscanned likeness and voice to the character.

Additionally, it features many elements of earlier Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the jet pack from Thunderball (1965) and the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964).From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor.

The game marked Pierce Brosnan's fourth appearance as James Bond before the release of his fourth and final Bond film Die Another Day. His likeness was featured in the game, but not his voice, which was provided by Maxwell Caulfield. Overall there are many weapons that the player can carry including grenades of various sorts and other types of explosives. In addition, there are numerous amounts of mounted weapons found throughout the game. As with previous James Bond games, the weapons that appear are based on actual weapons, but with the names changed. Some weapons appear in the console version but not the PC version, and vice-versa.","story":"The game's prologue mission starts in Paris, France, with James Bond helping French Intelligence operative Dominique Paradis evade a gang chase while chasing a truck with a stolen nuclear weapon, before continuing in his car. After stopping the truck from blowing up the Eiffel Tower, Dominique and James celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\nThe British Government sends Bond undercover to a party in industrialist Raphael Drake's Austrian castle. M believes that the party is a cover for the exchange of a missile guidance chip between Raphael Drake and Alexander Mayhew, who manages the Japanese branch of Drake's industry, Phoenix International, and had stolen the chip from the United States. Phoenix is believed to be a front for weapon smuggling. M gives Bond the instruction for 007 to rendezvous with CIA agent Zoe Nightshade and Dominique, who is posing as Drake's mistress. While Zoe distracts the guards, Bond makes his way to the exchange and steals the chip. Agents Nightshade and 007 make an try to make an escape on a cable car, when Drake's bodyguard, Rook, attacks the cable car with a rocket-launching helicopter. Bond shoots down the attacking helicopter using rockets found in the cable car. James and Zoe then escape Drake's forces in an armored snowmobile before continuing in James' car. They rendezvous with Q, who takes them out of Austria.\n\nAfter the breach, Drake threatens to kill Mayhew, should the operation fail. Mayhew contacts MI6, saying he will provide vital information if Bond comes to his rescue. At his Japanese estate, Mayhew is attacked by Drake's men, consisting of Japanese thugs. Bond fights his way through the estate and manages to obtain a file from Mayhew's safe. As they are prepared to make an escape from the estate, Mayhew is killed by a ninja. The file leads Bond to Mayhew's office at the Phoenix Building in Tokyo.\n\nBond is able to infiltrate the building while the guards are changing shifts and secures official NightFire documents. He is then attacked by Drake's men before Dominique provides a distraction, which allows Bond to escape via parachute off the roof of the building.\n\nThe NightFire documents lead Bond to a nuclear power plant being decommissioned by Phoenix International. Bond retrieves evidence of Drake's activities and escapes. However, he is then double crossed and captured by Kiko, Mayhew's former bodyguard, and turned over to Drake. On the top of the Phoenix building, Drake plans to kill Bond and Dominique, who has been discovered as a mole. Dominique is kicked off the rooftop and killed by Kiko. Bond escapes to the ground level before being saved by Australian Intelligence agent Alura McCall.\n\nM sends Bond and Alura to Drake's private island, where Drake has set up a jamming signal. The pair infiltrate the island and eliminate Drake's defenses. M makes Bond aware of the UN, EU, and NATO forces arriving on the island to dismantle remaining enemy combatants. Bond makes his way to Drake's underground silo, fighting off Kiko before entering one of three space shuttles intending to capture the Space Defense Platform. Kiko incinerates in the blast pit when Bond's space shuttle launches. Bond reaches the U.S. Space Defense Platform, where Drake is. He successfully sends all eight missiles off course, saving millions of lives, and causes Drake's laser weapon to malfunction, leading to a huge explosion. Finally, Bond kills Drake. As the station goes up in flames, Bond blasts from an escape pod and goes back down to Earth, where M informs him that astronomers from around the globe are reporting \"unexpected meteor showers\" (which is actually the debris of the now-destroyed Space Defense Platform).","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100003,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Shooter"},{"id":3774,"name":"1080° Avalanche","first_release_date":"11/27/2003","total_rating":70,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"videos":["DYwGPEOj7DI","ZNLWG8VHBHk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2eux.jpg","description":"1080° Avalanche is a snowboarding game for the Nintendo GameCube, developed by Nintendo's in-house development studio, NST, and published by Nintendo.

The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him.

Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties.

Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version.

A total of ten different venues are available, and one of the featured modes offers a storyline complete with soap opera-style drama to go along with the suplexes and body slams.

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","story":"The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location. \n \nThe chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story. \n \nIn 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100035,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"id":"ngc22","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},"genresDisplay":"Adventure"},{"id":3908,"name":"Evolution Skateboarding","first_release_date":"10/08/2002","total_rating":25,"esrb":"T","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/le9cr4bc5o5bisunimhk.jpg","description":"Evolution Skateboarding is a 2002 skateboarding video game released by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get. \n \nF-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off. \n \nFalcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil. \n \nAt his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible.

He fails the test and is held directly responsible for the \"death\" of 007. Charged with \"reckless brutality,\" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.\nThe agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at Auric Enterprises, where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename \"GoldenEye\"). Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At Hong Kong, GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the OMEN with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to Crab Key (Dr. No's base) with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.\nGoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the OMEN to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus that he can use to overload the OMEN.\nGoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the OMEN are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber that he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the OMEN, causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100045,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Shooter"},{"id":3936,"name":"Gotcha Force","first_release_date":"11/26/2003","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E","genres":["Fighting","Shooter","Simulator"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fhc.jpg","description":"Collect hundreds of borgs and battle them out to save the day!

Before releasing the first Knockout Kings, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, Foes of Ali, for the 3DO in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.  The Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.  In Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.  In Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.  Knockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.  Knockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.  After Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100054,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Sport"},{"id":45139,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition","first_release_date":"11/06/2003","total_rating":80,"esrb":"","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"videos":["Hg5x80DOEo8","oInUKR4Y4Bo","otDmIiZxhPQ","cRNwL_GwXAw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25m1.jpg","description":"Receive Four Complete Classic Zelda games all on one disc when you buy the Zelda GameCube Bundle: The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II - The adventure of Link, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.

Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay.

Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection \"medikits\" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.

It was released in 2004 on both the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube, making it the second-to-last game in the Mega Man X series to be released. Unique to the series, it is an RPG featuring turn-based combat and an extensive story. It plays quite similarly to Capcom's signature Breath of Fire series in a number of ways, due to the shared development team. Chronologically, it is currently the Mega Man X game set furthest in the future, taking place sometime in the twenty-third century (22XX time period); however, it is also set in an alternate timeline outside of the main storyline of the Mega Man series.The Gamecube version let's you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater. The PS2 version contains a Mega Man X8 Demo.","story":"Prologue\nIn the year 22XX AD, a mysterious mineral known as Force Metal was extracted from the fragments of a meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean. Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.\n\nEverything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.\n\nAfter the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.\n\nChapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!\nX, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.\n\nUpon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100073,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"id":4004,"name":"Metal Arms: Glitch in the System","first_release_date":"11/17/2003","total_rating":77,"esrb":"T","genres":["Shooter"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wa8.jpg","description":"Metal Arms: Glitch in the System is a third-person shooter action-adventure video game, developed by Swingin' Ape Studios and released in 2003.

The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidström, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow[1] and Harry Teinowitz.  Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.

Five years after the rebellion on Mars. For the last 15 years, Sopot, the corrupt dictator, has oppressed the people of the Commonwealth. His relentless pursuit of unification with the neighboring United Republic has left the country soaked in unnecessary bloodshed and poverty. Propaganda is plastered throughout communities and a Public Information Building, built as a tribute to the self-centered chancellor, spews news broadcasts with claims of victory as more and more soldiers fall victim. Fed up after years on the front lines, a group of super-soldiers injected with nanotechnology vow to replace the dictator and restore peace. Defend your country as Alias, a demolitions expert, with the help of your five squad members, each specializing in their own method of destruction. Fight through diverse levels using vehicles, an arsenal of specialized weapons and massive explosives in your rampage to overthrow the government.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed \"Alias\") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth. \n \nEventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \"The Processed\". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player's squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him. \n \nAlias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad's leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth's military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov's commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory's power generators. Alias's explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass. \n \nAlias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot's statue with the nanotech cell – the culmination of Capek's research – and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov's subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov's fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player's Heroics score.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100094,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Strategy"},{"id":974,"name":"Resident Evil 4","first_release_date":"01/10/2005","total_rating":85,"esrb":"M","genres":["Shooter"],"videos":["2ORc25vZo54"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wk8.jpg","description":"Resident Evil 4 is a 2005 survival horror video game published and developed by Capcom.

The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoring ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostreinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat. Driven either to possess or destroy it, they join a new journey, while Nightmare begins his rampage, seeking souls to restore Soul Edge once again.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":32,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":32,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100107,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Sport"},{"id":4166,"name":"SpyHunter","first_release_date":"03/09/2002","total_rating":59,"esrb":"T","genres":["Racing"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p1e.jpg","description":"Released originally in 2001, Spy Hunter is a remake of the 1983 classic arcade game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100108,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genresDisplay":"Racing"},{"id":4174,"name":"SSX 3","first_release_date":"10/19/2003","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport","Adventure"],"videos":["sMiq5Wi2dxs","4n2FWQSJWbA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1o4m.jpg","description":"Players can discover the open mountain in the newest version of the smash-hit SSX snowboarding franchise.

Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.  Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.  Fox McCloud agrees to take a look.

Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.  To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.  Fox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.  In order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console.  Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.","story":"This game has a story that is only told in the Japanese version. Here is an excerpt, translated from Japanese: \n \nAiAi, MeeMee, and Baby are a good family and live peacefully in Jungle Island. One day, out of the distant islands, GonGon, leader of the Gorillas, brought in a raid to the island. They intend to hog all the bananas for themselves! AiAi escaped from the spot, and got tired and fell asleep. In his dreams, AiAi was told in his dreams there is a paradise called \"Banana Island\" in the sky from the \"Grand Monkey\". But in order to go there, you have to go through a couple of traps and gimmicks. But the Grand Monkey taught AiAi a magical spell: \"Ei Ei Poo!\" That protects him from any danger. AiAi wakes up quickly, and as he says \"Ei Ei Poo!\", A big ball flies out of the sky He gets insides of it and flies high above the sky. Now, survive several traps and tricks, and aim for it! Banana Island! \n \nWhen the player completes the Master Stages (in which the setting is above Banana Island), if they play as AiAi, MeeMee, or Baby, they will be able to go to Banana Island and enjoy all the bananas it has to offer. However, if you play as GonGon, he will be locked out of the place in which the bananas are kept while the other monkeys enjoy the bananas inside.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100121,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":["Nintendo GameCube launch title"],"extraDataFull":{"id":"ngc76","name":"Super Monkey Ball","details":["Nintendo GameCube launch title"],"igdbId":2927,"gbId":7247,"gbGuid":"3030-7247","tgdbId":6780,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]},"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Racing, Pinball"},{"id":2928,"name":"Super Monkey Ball 2","first_release_date":"08/24/2002","total_rating":71,"esrb":"E","genres":["Puzzle","Sport","Strategy","Pinball"],"videos":["ekm_ounBFDw","X73QJ_M6LDA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f3o.jpg","description":"The object of Super Monkey Ball 2 is to guide a monkey trapped inside a plastic ball through a maze to the goal.

The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.  All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.  When dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.  In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.  There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.","story":"Vicious predators from the far ends of the universe are invading our planet!

Yuri Sakazaki has been abducted by Mr. Big to punish her father, Takuma, and her brother, Ryo. To rescue her, Ryo and Robert must take on numerous enemies around South Town, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. Karate. The passion of the game’s creators is evident in the unique game play elements introduced. These include an energy gauge that is depleted every time a fighter uses a special maneuver, Desperation Attacks that are usable only when a fighter’s health is low, and camera zooming that adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the stage.

By collecting power ups and using fast reflexes, B.O.B. tries to find his way off the asteroid and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds. \n \nAt the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard. B.O.B., frustrated with his obnoxious date, declares \"That's the girl for me!\" and drives off in pursuit of the red female. The game ends with a shot of B.O.B. and his new date sitting on a small asteroid together, staring out at the beauty of the cosmos in silence. Behind them, B.O.B.'s car (in the backseat of which his date had stashed her surfboard) stalls and drifts off into space, presumably leaving them stranded together but neither of the lovers seem to notice.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100237,"name":"B.O.B.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":48,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cmcz4pho6gib6lfmc1iw.jpg","description":"There's no time like the past and there's no time to lose!Great Scott!

Despite his PR claiming that he received an \"unofficial license\" from Sega to distribute the game, Sega really asked him to remove their copyrights and trademarks, consequently making the translation fully unlicensed (while Blue Almanac is fully licensed).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100277,"name":"Blue Almanac","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":62,"esrb":"","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jso94gbldpk7hvre8wq6.jpg","description":"Just who are these guys?

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).  The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100280,"name":"Boxing Legends of the Ring","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Sport","Boxing"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Sport, Boxing"},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1993","total_rating":64,"videos":["_q0VNbyf7Vw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2w16.jpg","description":"The release for the Super NES and Megadrive/Genesis releases were platforming action games that are identical to each other, but have a few alterations depending on the version.

The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.  Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.  Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.  Gameplay[edit] The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs.

The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations.Cannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.","story":"Cannon Fodder is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates - destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion - at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition.\n\nThe player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games.[9] As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100298,"name":"Cannon Fodder","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Top-down shooter"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Strategy, Top-down shooter"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":63,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qnf.jpg","description":"Captain America and the Avengers is an arcade game released by Data East in 1991.

Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe. \n \nThe game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them. Even though the resurrection of Dracula was a success, the vampire hunters defeated him, and his allies.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100302,"name":"Castlevania: Bloodlines","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":90,"videos":["LRkc0sIJh94"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zrp.jpg","description":"The year is 275 B.C.

The premise of the game is that the main character, Casey, can use masks to change into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as Chameleon Kid (カメレオン キッド Kamereon Kiddo?).  The game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on May 22, 2007; North America on May 28, 2007; and Europe on June 1, 2007. It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2. The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","story":"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100305,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1993","videos":["8hDFdRavC6k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cse9bfvt7i1pz1qmpydz.jpg","description":"This soccer game offers 32 national teams to play, with none of the players' names shown.

Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball.

However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.  Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100360,"name":"Demolition Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1995","total_rating":81,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p542uxh1n4evabipjzdu.jpg","description":"Play either the Road Runner OR Wile E.

Upon meeting and conversing with the castle's true owner and king, Mickey is told that in order to defeat Mizrabel he must find the Seven Gems of the Rainbow. Majority of the seven gems are kept within various illusion-filled worlds (known in the game as levels), and are being guarded by Mizrabel's henchmen – which are known as the Masters of Illusion. Alongside the Masters of Illusion are bizarre creatures - such as enchanted mushrooms, toy soldiers, ball-juggling unicycle-riding clowns, and armored knights that Mickey must face. After thanking the castellan and hurrying into the castle hallway, Mickey begins to search through five doors that each lead to a different level. The levels are The Enchanted Forest, Toyland, The Storm, Dessert Factory, The Library, and finally, The Castle. \n \nQuackShot Starring Donald Duck: \nWhile Donald is flipping through some books in Uncle Scrooge's library, a treasure map from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck kingdom, falls out.

Unfortunately, Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure. \n \nDonald, using a partial map from the library, travels to a variety of places around the world seeking clues to find the treasure, including Duckburg and Mexico. After defeating Count Dracula in Transylvania, Donald receives a more complete map pointing to the Maharajah in India, Egypt, a haunted Viking ship, and finally the South Pole, where Donald finds an ancient Viking diary said to reveal the location of the treasure. However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that if the map is dipped in water, it will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100371,"name":"Disney Collection - Castle of Illusion & Quackshot","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"11/10/1993","total_rating":81,"videos":["r6KTNlXQjPs","zn6wjsaGePQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1x0w.jpg","description":"Disney's Aladdin is a platform video game developed by Virgin Interactive based on the 1992 motion picture of the same name.

Techniques range from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.  There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.  The game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the gang's hideout.

A podmate challenges Ecco to a game to see how high he can jump into the air. When he is in the air, a giant waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay, Ecco swims around meeting other marine life including other dolphins who tell them they have felt the storm and the entire ocean is in chaos. An orca Ecco encounters tells him to travel to the Arctic to meet the \"Big Blue,\" an old blue whale revered by marine life for its age and wisdom, who might be able to help him on his journey. Arriving in the Arctic after a long travel through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue who informs the dolphin the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn't know what causes the storms, he suggests Ecco find the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. The Asterite greets Ecco telling him though it has the power to aid him, the Asterite cannot because orbs from its body have been lost. The Asterite tells him to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, and use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans. \n \nEcco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals stored with information. From the library Ecco learns the origins of the storms, an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet, so every 500 years when the planets align, they use their technology to harvest the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex that ended when a beam struck Atlantis from space sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated she spits out Ecco's pod she ate and they make their quick escape back to Earth.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100400,"name":"Ecco the Dolphin","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd74","name":"Ecco the Dolphin","igdbId":5378,"gbId":9286,"gbGuid":"3030-9286","tgdbId":132,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qcyvdk1p51xbf4ca1th4.jpg","description":"ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game with both exhibition and playoff modes.

It is unrelated to the earlier Activision game (though their name still appears in the copyright screen), and is instead a run and gun game in which the player takes control of squat cartoon representations of three of the four Ghostbusters from the movie, with the noticeable absence of Winston Zeddemore. Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as \"middle ghosts\"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.","story":"The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie).

The three Ghostbusters piece together the mysterious tablet, inadvertently opening a portal to \"the evil world\" and releasing a horde of ghosts. In the end, though, the Ghostbusters manage to defeat Janna, the God of Darkness, and retrieve a mystical gem from the evil world.

Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.  By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil magician that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack.  There are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level 1 to 5 twice.

The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail.

An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100468,"name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"12/26/1991","total_rating":78,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qgu.jpg","description":"Just UpdatedAll SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis titles now launch using the new SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis Interactive Hub, with all new features, UI and Steam Workshop Support!About the GameThe Lord of Darkness, Dark Guld, has arisen again.

The player can perform a variety of different attacks (punches, kicks, and finishing blows) depending on the position of an enemy. By pressing both buttons while surrounded by enemies, the player can perform a special attack that strikes every enemy around him. By pressing both buttons while holding the joystick upwards, the player will perform a longer jump.The player can procure weapons by destroying barrels and wooden crates or disarming certain enemies. There are a total of eight weapons which can be obtained: three melee weapons (a pipe, a sword and a whip), two throwing weapons (knives and hand grenades), and three firearms (a pistol, a machine gun, and a rocket launcher). The barrels and crates can also be picked up and thrown at enemies as well. When the machine gun or rocket launcher runs out of ammunition, these are still wielded by the player as melee weapons. The pistol, on the other hand, is thrown by the player after all of its bullets are used. The player can drop his current weapon by pressing down and attack while wielding it. If a weapon lies on the ground after a certain period, it will vanish completely.There are seven regular stages (called rounds) and a bonus game, for a total of eight stages. The locations include a city, a moving train, a boat, a jungle, a cavern, and the hideout of the poachers. There are six types of enemy characters throughout the game, excluding the final boss (who has two forms).

It is an early real-time strategy game, predating the genre-popularizing Dune II. Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy.  In Herzog Zwei, the player directly pilots a flying, transforming mech, a multi-role robot suited for utility and combat. Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (which are fairly basic: patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed. Tactical re-deployment (mission reassignment, vehicle repair) involves a great deal of micromanagement, due to the required involvement of the mech.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100489,"name":"Herzog Zwei","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Herzog Zwei","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"id":"smd110","igdbId":24073,"gbId":11439,"gbGuid":"3030-11439","tgdbId":486,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Real Time Strategy (RTS), Strategy"},{"first_release_date":"08/15/1993","total_rating":69,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/am37yxsfam3wowihjflg.jpg","description":"High Seas Havoc, known in Japan as Captain Lang, was also for arcade machines running on a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis based cabinet.","story":"The story is about an anthropomorphic pirate seal named Havoc (Lang in the Japanese version), his young sidekick Tide (Land in the Japanese version), a girl named Bridget, and an evil pirate named Bernardo.

You discover you're not immortal! You're a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal!  The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.  Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.  The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.","story":"The game begins with the player in control of an unnamed wizard.

Along the way, Bond must battle numerous thugs and familiar bosses.The game is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond, his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens, thus making it Dalton's last appearance in a Bond game to date. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark. It was also the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel. Instead it featured an original storyline, albeit one featuring familiar villains including Jaws and Oddjob. Though the game's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders EA, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, Operation Stealth, included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the licence added for its North American release.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100517,"name":"James Bond 007: The Duel","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sq4oozb4fiqqdcxtd5az.jpg","description":"Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing.

The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.  A nefarious supervillain named \"Doctor Maybe\" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name \"James Pond\" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests.

'Whirlwind' Snooker is a highly realistic snooker simulator. Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it made full use of the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.  Despite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful pot was a resounding \"pop\" and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such.  The game was followed by Archer MacLean's Pool in 1992 and Jimmy White's 2: Cueball in 1999.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100530,"name":"Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Snooker","Pool"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Snooker, Pool"},{"first_release_date":"12/05/1991","total_rating":63,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dgu.jpg","description":"Back in the distant past (way back - like when “rock and roll” was just rock and fast food was dinner you couldn’t catch), lived two cave dudes named Joe and Mac.

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).  Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100540,"name":"Joshua & The Battle of Jericho","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle"},{"first_release_date":"06/01/1995","total_rating":48,"esrb":"T","videos":["eO2sPSY6_uc","OMhZyg2A514","sQexHWFIZkQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s0ljjre9kx2r0ofnkyuf.jpg","description":"Judge Dredd is an action video game for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear and Game Boy originally released in 1995.

The premise of the game is that the main character, Casey, can use masks to change into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as Chameleon Kid (カメレオン キッド Kamereon Kiddo?).  The game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on May 22, 2007; North America on May 28, 2007; and Europe on June 1, 2007. It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2. The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","story":"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100550,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"07/25/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ywr.jpg","description":"King Colossus is a top-down action role-playing game.

The Sceptre of Order rested safely in his hands, keeping at bay the forces of darkness that infested the world. Children were happy. Merchants prospered. Honest folks made honest livings. And nobody complained much.But far across the waters, Arech Dragonbreath, leader of the Dark Legions, looked enviously upon the wealth and splendor of the four continents. With the aid of great magic, Arech stole into the chambers of King Maximus and wrested the Sceptre from the grip of the sleeping King. He then released his evil forces, ordering his minions and lieutenants to seize the land in whatever manner they pleased (as long as it involved considerable amounts of pain and terror). Arech retired to his new lair on the four continents and waited for King Maximus’s certain resistance. The King and his forces, however, offered none. Fearing some kind of trickery, Arech peered into his prophetic crystal to see what Maximus was up to. The crystal showed the King lying in bed, his face pale and gaunt like death itself. Over the King stood a noble young knight with the strength and resolve of great leader. The King was speaking. \"Come here\" he gasped, \"I am weak and breath is a luxury. Please.\" He extended his hand and the great leader drew close. \"You must restore my kingdom. I, too, must be restored. I am tied to this land and as it dies, so do I. My days here are numbered. You must recover the Sceptre if I and my land are to live.\"Arech watched this exchange and quickly buried the Sceptre somewhere on the four continents. He draw a map of its location, then shredded it into 25 pieces. He gave one to each of his 16 villainous nobles, kept one for himself, and the other eight he hid with powerful artifacts around the four continents. Your time grows short, leader. You have your quest and King Maximus’s last hope. May you be guarded in your journey by the Spirits of Order.

The player takes control of Aarzak (Kenshiro in the Japanese original), who fights against his enemies using his punches and kicks. Aarzak can attack while standing, jumping, and crouching, for a total of six basic attacks. In addition to his life gauge, Aarzak has a power-up meter that will gradually fill as he defeats enemies. When the meter reaches a certain point (depending on the stage), Aarzak will transform into a super-powered state, allowing him to perform rapid punches and kicks for the rest of the stage. The game's levels (with the exception of boss battles and maze stages) feature a time limit at the lower-right corner of the screen; but unlike other time limits, instead of killing the character immediately when it reaches, it will instead gradually drain the player's life gauge until the player completes the level.  The game is divided into four stages or chapters, each featuring several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk from one to side to the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps. The player will encounter various allies throughout the game that will increase Aarzak's offensive or defensive strength, or replenish their health. The game features several one-on-one encounters with bosses as well. The player must sometime complete levels in a certain order in order to finish a chapter.  'Last Battle' is also notorious amongst gamers for its harsh difficulty throughout.  The original Japanese version ist based on the Fist of the North Star mangas/animes. During the translation process all references to Fist of the North Star were removed - similar to its predecessor Black Belt.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100565,"name":"Last Battle","extraData":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Last Battle","id":"smd132","details":["Genesis launch title","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"igdbId":27971,"gbId":12187,"gbGuid":"3030-12187","tgdbId":4482,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"},{"first_release_date":"10/31/1993","total_rating":60,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dp8.jpg","description":"The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in \"Project 5\", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.  With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100566,"name":"The Lawnmower Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"10/06/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yx3.jpg","description":"An evil wizard.

Character abilities:  All three Vikings (Erik, Baleog and Olaf) have three health points which they can lose by getting hurt by enemies or by falling from great heights, and the ability to carry and use items, mainly keys, bombs, and food (which restore health points). Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities:  Erik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet. Baleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\"). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance. Olaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider.

When a player completes a race, the remaining time is added to the next race's allotted time. The game also allows two players to compete against each other.  Courses are populated with various objects and enemies designed to obstruct the player. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles.

Summary[edit] The game takes place in a floating post-apocalyptic Japan. The player emerges in the middle of Tokyo's Akihabara district where the buildings have turned into ruins. Countless demons have managed to destroy cities everywhere and the people are all hiding underground. Getting home to the Shinjuku district will allow the player to uncover more of the plot. Mysterious artificats called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts) help to play a role in this invasion by a mysterious civilization.

Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts. \n \nMazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger. \n \nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100605,"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd142","igdbId":36947,"gbId":26959,"gbGuid":"3030-26959","tgdbId":635,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"09/22/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qnq.jpg","description":"McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure starring Ronald McDonald.

The game consists of six stages, with the first two stages and the final one covering events from the film, whereas Stage 3 to 5 are set before the events of the film and adapts key episodes from the TV show's second season (namely \"White Light\", \"Ninja Encounter\", and \"Power Transfer\"). The game's soundtrack, composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, features hard rock arrangements of Ron Wasserman's original TV themes.  The game contains a total of nine rangers: Tommy, Adam, Kimberly, Billy, Aisha, Rocky, Zach, Trini, and Jason. When selecting Jason, Zach, and Trini, the voice clips of Adam, Aisha, and Rocky are heard when calling out their respective Zord name as their morphing command. The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach. There are cinematic scenes in digitized form that are abridged from the movie and some from Season 2 of the show. Lord Zedd, Goldar, the Putty Patrol, and Oozemen appear as sub-enemies. Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, AC, and DC are renamed in this title as Sentinel Neck, Sentinel Ear, and Sentinel Ring respectively. Players also can fight the Ecto-Morphicons using Ninja Megazord or Falcon Zord (both by 2-Player mode; Thunder Megazord and Mega Tigerzord against the Sentinels).

The tournament is dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will unbalance the furies and allow Outworld to subsume Earthrealm.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100637,"name":"Mortal Kombat II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting"},{"first_release_date":"07/31/1994","total_rating":63,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sbrnao42bvkpgagho0nf.jpg","description":"You are the cool squirrel of the title, and you must defeat the evil Yeti before he freezes the entire world.

This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.  Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.  Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","story":"NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.\nA key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine. While the game was powering back on, the player holds Up and all buttons on player 1 and Down and all buttons on player 2.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100650,"name":"NBA Jam","extraData":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"NBA Jam","id":"smd160","details":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"igdbId":8995,"gbId":16928,"gbGuid":"3030-16928","special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Sport","Basketball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Basketball"},{"first_release_date":"12/15/1994","esrb":"E","videos":["3JROy8CY8zQ","MmHq451JNRw","P6WaD41K4DE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ov7vvjuszdc0gtrljnj5.jpg","description":"The first of the NBA Live video games series.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.  The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100698,"name":"Pac-Attack","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle"},{"first_release_date":"04/05/1994","total_rating":69,"videos":["SEYxgqnK27c"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sss.jpg","description":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, known in Japan as Hello! Pac-Man, is a side-scrolling adventure game \"sequel\" to Pac-Man. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. It was produced and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis systems, and was released on April 6, 1994 by Namco. The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac-Land, and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series, such as Pac-Man's family and a main villain commanding the ghosts. The Genesis version was not released in Japan or Europe.","story":"After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's, for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he takes on disgruntled baloon salesmen and disgruntled security guards to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.\nDuring the game, the player can direct Pac-Man to one of two video arcades where a conversion of the original Pac-Man (based on the NES version, but with 16-bit graphics) can be played. The player can also complete an optional side quest by collecting three missing cartridge pieces. Once completed, a bonus game is unlocked in the arcades – in the SNES version, the bonus game is Ms. Pac-Man, while in the Mega Drive/Genesis version, an exclusive game called Pac-Jr. is unlocked instead. Pac-Jr. is a graphic and level hack of Ms. Pac-Man, and not a conversion of the unauthorized arcade game Jr. Pac-Man. This was done because a Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man was already released prior to this game and Namco did not own the rights to Jr. Pac-Man at the time.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100699,"name":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"11/29/1987","total_rating":80,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mu7.jpg","description":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.   GAMEPLAY: The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.  The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.  Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.  Delivering the papers The paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.   In Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. The primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.  Keeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.  The player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.  There are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.  Along the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.  A 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.   Training course Paperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker. The end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.   Finish line bug A bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.  Recapping the delivery The next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.  The game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.  Losing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"  The arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.   PORTS: Paperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.  Unlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.  More recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003. A Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.  Paperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.  An iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100704,"name":"Paperboy","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Simulator, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":58,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qxj.jpg","description":"You're a paper boy.

After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has been reduced to desert, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the \"biomonsters,\" a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia's flora and fauna. \n \nKeeping these creatures under control is the job of \"hunters\". During an investigation into such an outbreak, Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, learns of the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet's ecological crisis.

The parent star, Algol (referred to as \"Algo\" by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm (\"Palma\"), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota (\"Motavia\"), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo (\"Dezoris\"), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet. \n \nOne thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic. Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the climatrol tower, the bio-systems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need. \n \nThe game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize (but who resembles Alis) is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota's capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the commander, the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission. \n \nThe first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with cat-like features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei's origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota's climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, bringing an end to Mota's Biomonster hazard. \n \nHowever, this sets another incident in motion: the exploding impact causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain's security robots and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler. \n \nThe group boards Mota's last plane to Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion. Upon reaching there, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf's past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the system, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable against the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides. \n \nIt is eventually revealed that Dark Force has been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo's resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends there on an open-ended note, with the outcome of the fight left unrevealed.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100714,"name":"Phantasy Star II","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd185","name":"Phantasy Star II","igdbId":1232,"gbId":4492,"gbGuid":"3030-4492","tgdbId":678,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"04/20/1990","total_rating":77,"esrb":"E","videos":["JVCDO2khgfY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hznnuruplld14i7zu9gl.jpg","description":"Just as you’re about to marry Maia, the mysterious woman you found on the shore, a winged dragon grabs her and disappears.

The game takes names and little else from Greek mythology in which Apollo, god of the sun, was actually Artemis's brother. The game shows players an Artemis that acts as an stereotypical princess (but in Greek mythology, she was the goddess of the hunt, and took pride in never being with any man).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100717,"name":"Phelios","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":["JxNsG2Fv7rk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2kcy.jpg","description":"Compared to the Super Nintendo version, this version has different level designs among other differences.","story":"The Pink Panther is on his way to Hollywood to audition for an important role.

While the sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar, a wizard, seizes power. His only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan's daughter (although the game never specifically mentions how). Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder levels). The game's unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. But in addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelgänger, an apparition of his own self that is conjured out of a magic mirror.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100735,"name":"Prince of Persia","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/opfzrwwpqvd51djrj4fk.jpg","description":"Pro Quarterback is a Sports game, developed and published by Tradewest, which was released in 1992.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100736,"name":"Pro Quarterback","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Arcade","Football"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Arcade, Football"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vxxfddqd5apmyba4pczr.jpg","description":"Puggsy is no ordinary game.

Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.","story":"Much like other games from the same timeframe, such as Gunstar Heroes, the game's story varied between the Japanese language release and its English language counterpart.

The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy to restore peace to the galaxy. \n \nIn the English-language version, Oruto is omitted altogether. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100769,"name":"Ristar","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1987","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vndpo5pahnoezgh6arvv.jpg","description":"The objective of the game is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel.

For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as a bonus. Players can get fuel in four ways: green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point.

Knowing the Pig Star had the power to destroy entire worlds, El Zebulos had it placed under a magic seal for safekeeping. The \"Key to the Seal\" would be guarded and passed down by El Zebulos, and his Royal Family. Generations into the future, the kingdom has been subject to attack by neighboring countries which wanted control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights were formed. These Warriors wore armor with Rocket Packs, wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills. \n \nAround this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age. Later on, a corrupt Rocket Knight by the name of Axel Gear fought and wounded Mifune as he tried to steal an ancient book, which contained the secrets of the rocket knights. Sparkster was appointed the new Rocket Knight leader and spent 10 years posing as an outlaw as he searched for Axel Gear, only to return to Zebulos and hear rumors about Axel Gear's return. \n \nBy now the Kingdom is under attack by the Devotindos Empire led by Emperor Devligus Devotindos; who is said to have the power of hypnosis. Sparkster finds that Axel Gear has kidnapped Princess Sherry in attempt to blackmail the king into surrendering The \"Key to the Seal\". However it just so happens that the Princess is the only one who knows of its location. Sparkster rushes through jungles, caves, and even into Devotindos territory to save the princess.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100775,"name":"Rocket Knight Adventures","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Rocket Knight Adventures","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd200","igdbId":9766,"gbId":6339,"gbGuid":"3030-6339","tgdbId":685,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1992","total_rating":57,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2up0.jpg","description":"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends was a game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System based after the famous Rocky and Bullwinkle show.

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.  The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.  A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100777,"name":"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Simulator","Sport","Baseball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Simulator, Sport, Baseball"},{"first_release_date":"11/17/1991","esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nfy.jpg","description":"A terrorist group has taken out the world information flow and, as either a guy named Albert Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies 1 square. Units can belong to one of two sides: allies (controlled by the player) or enemies (controlled by the computer AI). Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit also has the option to attack, cast a spell, use an item, search (if adjacent to a treasure chest), or stay and do nothing, all of which end the unit's turn. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions, and the character's turn is able to continue. The order of the turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed. Units can use offensive actions, such as physical attacks or offensive magic, only on units belonging to the other side and can use supportive actions, such as healing magic, stat-enhancing magic, and items, only on units belonging to the same side.","story":"The game opens in the Kingdom of Guardiana, in the land of Rune.

The following day, King Granseal falls sick when he is attacked by an unknown creature and Sir Astral, the court's advisor, along with his apprentices, Bowie the squire, Sarah the healer and Chester the knight, investigate these events at the castle.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.  The player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.  All the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100827,"name":"Sorcerian","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"10/28/1988","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E","videos":["4B3Taj-GESc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gsm.jpg","description":"A call for help comes from deep in the universe.

All versions of the video game are side-scrolling platform games, whereby the player controls superhero Spider-Man to battle various supervillains (Doctor Octopus, Sandman, The Lizard, Hobgoblin, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, and Venom) to obtain the keys needed to disarm a nuclear bomb that the Kingpin has not only framed Spider-Man for stealing but plans to detonate within twenty-four hours. In the middle of the game, Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson is also kidnapped by Venom.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100836,"name":"The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/u6fxxjpvw7qe6b33cfrl.jpg","description":"A Legend of Zelda inspired game in which the player guides a character who converts non-believers, fights demons, and ultimately goes up against Satan himself.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100837,"name":"Spiritual Warfare","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1995","total_rating":53,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2doq.jpg","description":"This is a simple platform game, you're in a role of porter, jumping down the streets and buildings, and taking as many points as you can get.

They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost contact with a vessel patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols. \n \nImmediately upon beginning play, the Enterprise receives a distress signal, broadcasting on all frequencies. It was sent out by one Dr. T'Laris, a Vulcan geologist stationed on a planet in the Codis Mu system (Codis Mu VI), and in the message she notes that her dig site was recently attacked by Romulans, and that the assailants are still present. The Enterprise responds to her plea for help and sets a course to her dig site. \n \nAs the game progresses, the player learns more about the missing Romulan vessel's mission, and of the IFD. The Enterprise also makes contact with an alien race known as the Chodak, hostile mollusk-like creatures who constantly accost the Enterprise as it traverses known space gathering clues about the IFD. There are also mentions of a now-extinct race called the Senatorious who were the last race to possess the IFD; the reason it resurfaced is because the Senatorious understood that they'd been using the IFD for their own benefit at the cost of all other races, and judiciously decided to send it ten thousand years into the future, in the hopes that civilizations then could put the IFD to use for the mutual benefit of all races. There is one more race, the gaunt Eunacians, which are encountered only once and, after the Enterprise repairs their ship, tell Jean-Luc Picard of the IFD Trials and the Eunacians' intention to participate. However, with their ship crippled, and the rest of their race residing in the Gamma Quadrant, they entrust the Federation with recovery of the IFD, and its judicious use.","player_perspectives":["First person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100846,"name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Echoes from the Past","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"08/14/1986","total_rating":79,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jjh8brp8ii5nlfvdk4rr.jpg","description":"Starflight is a space exploration role-playing adventure video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986.

Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook.

Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively.  The game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","story":"Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the \"Grandmaster\" rules over the world. Hiryu, the youngest ever Super A Ranked[2] member of an organization of high-tech ninja-like agents known as the \"Striders\", is alone tasked with the Grandmaster's assassination. Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster's capital at the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100854,"name":"Strider","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd226","name":"Strider","igdbId":6969,"gbId":26410,"gbGuid":"3030-26410","tgdbId":702,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"03/31/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1x9w.jpg","description":"The warrior returns with a vengeance in his ultimate fight for freedom!

The events are:  Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.  400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event.  High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.  Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100857,"name":"The Games: Summer Challenge","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Sport"},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1991","total_rating":79,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2p0v.jpg","description":"You're a brave bounty hunter pursuing outlaw scum like Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, and Chief Scalpen.

It incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called \"MF\" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player.  The game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their HP and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their \"Load Capacity\" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses cut scenes for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to Ys, a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.","story":"Many years after the events of Hydlide II, an explosion of flames appeared near The City of the Woods.

One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest. The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

It is the second entry in the Test Drive series of video games.","story":"Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent. \n \nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course. \n \nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left. \n \nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player’s car, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn’t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100905,"name":"The Duel: Test Drive II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Simulator, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1984","total_rating":87,"videos":["rUCN84SviLc","Ql81jI4DpgQ","uRrTA8NqPpQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ufk.jpg","description":"Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game.

The title of the compilation is Taito Legends.  The gameplay for Thunder Fox is similar to other popular side scrolling action games like Namco's Rolling Thunder (video game), and Sega's Shinobi (arcade game). There are three buttons for each player - Attack, which normally is used to make Thunder and Fox (the game's heroes) stab with their knives. Jump, and a Weapon button which fires or throws a weapon acquired by the heroes.

Played from a 2D-top-down perspective the game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth. The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction. Since its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\".","story":"The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth.

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.  You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks.

Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan's earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.  Another draw of Twin Hawk is the game's unique \"smartbomb\" in the form of a group of friendly planes; pressing button 2 once will call in six Flying Fortresses to surround and protect the player's plane, and provide back-up fire. They are easily taken down by enemy fire, so the player must use them wisely.  Pressing button 2 again immediately after the call-in will sacrifice the planes for a more typical smartbomb. Otherwise, pressing button 2 while any other plane is on-screen will suicide them all into the nearest enemies below.","story":"At the end of an alternate World War II, a new European country is formed called Gorongo. General Giovanni of the Gorongo military was infuriated with the results of the war and what it meant to the country of Gorongo, initiating a rebellion against the country’s government that was widely followed by his soldiers. Holing themselves up on Bobo Island, south of Gorongo, Giovanni declared the occupation as the independent state of Fuangania and plotted to take over Gorongo. After taking over the town of Kusunoki, the Fuangania invasion – consisting of massive ground and sea attack forces – started to spread. \n \nGorongo President Bratt ordered a counterattack that focused on the one type of firepower Giovanni lacked: an air force. The special air force \"Daisenpuu\" sets up a mountain base after spotting a secret Fuangania fortress under construction. However, nearing the end of their training, the airforce is spotted by the Fuangania and are preparing to attack.

While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile. \n \nEach player has a life bar, which decreases each time they're hit. Some enemies can grab onto the players and drain their life. A player loses a life when his life bar reaches zero. If the hit that finishes a player is an explosion or flame, he slumps to the ground burnt. The life bar can be fully refilled between stages, with a cut scene showing the player(s) punching a \"Power Cola\" vending machine causing sodas to fall out which they drink, those vending machines also featured in most stages as replenishment points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100941,"name":"Two Crude Dudes","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Platform, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"},{"first_release_date":"10/05/1995","total_rating":69,"esrb":"M","videos":["eF3FmhDs9Q0","zPFJ9RZITjs"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y06.jpg","description":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more.

There are 3 types of jets varying from different classes of speeds and firepower. The Silph is the midrange plane with the most balance. While the Valkyrie carries the most firepower, and the Seylen jet is capable of flying at the highest mach speed. Weapon upgrades are available throughout the game, ranging from homing missiles, ring guns, flame throwers and many more. Each jet may also activate the shield manually in times of trouble. Weapons  Players have a choice between four different standard pick-up weapons: Vulcan – the player's default weapon which fires straight forward, but can flare out to destroy larger groups of enemies depending on the jet selected. Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded. Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.  Every jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100954,"name":"Vapor Trail","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"10/23/1995","total_rating":80,"esrb":"","videos":["NcL_kM9twZk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2k56.jpg","description":"By the year 2049, Earth has been turned into a toxic waste dump.

Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828.  In 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music.  The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.  As in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.  There are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100976,"name":"1943: Kai","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"12/15/1994","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s632aabjde3m82yllvqq.jpg","description":"A property-trading board game featuring aliens, robots and other unusual characters.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100977,"name":"21 Emon: Mezase!

The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.  Control of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100982,"name":"Aoi Blink","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1988","esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2vf2.jpg","description":"Formation Armed F is a vertically scrolling shooter.

The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress.

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.  Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.  The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100998,"name":"Bonk's Revenge","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ogn.jpg","description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100999,"name":"Bonk III: Bonk's Big Adventure","extraData":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Bonk III: Bonk's Big Adventure","id":"tg168","details":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"igdbId":12493,"gbId":11312,"gbGuid":"3030-11312","special":[{"value":"TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title, TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player","forPlatform":{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"03/15/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yn8.jpg","description":"The player controls a worker in a warehouse.

Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link's gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.Four characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.There are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash. The environments differ significantly, from pleasant meadows to caves, and from forests to underwater environments. Some foes encountered in these levels are derived from common mythology while others are completely made up for the game.","story":"The game setting is a medieval fantasy world similar to that of the high fantasy seen in The Lord of the Rings. The demons and abominations of nature who reside in the underground kingdom of Cadash have not forgotten that, thousands of years previously, they once shared the light with humans. Then one rose among them who was especially powerful, a demonic wizard born of a human woman – the Balrog (Baarogue or Baalogue in the arcade version, and Barlog in the TurboGrafx version). The Balrog promised his followers they could, in time, emerge from their subterranean prison and rule the world of men, taking revenge on humans for their prior defeat in battle and subsequent exile, if the Balrog could mingle his blood with that of a human king. The Balrog and his demonic armies gathered in force over the centuries, and are now powerful enough to emerge to the surface and make war with the unprepared human kingdoms which had not known war for millennia, all of which quickly fall to the Balrog. The human world is almost entirely laid to waste by the Balrog. However, this was not enough for the Balrog, whose prize is the mightiest of all human kingdoms, the Kingdom of Dirzir. One night, the beautiful Princess Salassa is kidnapped by the Balrog from the Keep of Deerzar, the capital city of Dirzir, and taken underground to the dreaded Castle Cadash. There the Balrog plans to initiate the ritual which would magically bind himself to the human princess, becoming all-powerful and invincible. Dilsarl, the distraught and helpless elderly King of Dirzir, has vowed to give his entire kingdom to the one who would rescue his beloved only daughter, and many brave heroes have disappeared into the depths of Cadash on this quest.","player_perspectives":["Text"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101006,"name":"Cadash","extraData":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Cadash","id":"tg1610","details":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"igdbId":6652,"gbId":18068,"gbGuid":"3030-18068","special":[{"value":"TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title, TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player","forPlatform":{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"01/13/1991","videos":null,"description":"Champion Wrestler gained popularity in the arcade, and now it is reborn on the PC Engine!

The tail can be used to climb vines scattered around, which allows the chameleon to ascend through the stage.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101011,"name":"Circus Lido","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":[],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":""},{"first_release_date":"03/01/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kfan6e6eodtasuwgmqf2.jpg","description":"A side-scrolling action game based on the manga and anime of the same name, concerning the private eye Ryo Saeba.

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.  Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.  Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101019,"name":"Cyber Knight","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG), Strategy"},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1992","videos":["jRRX7jS4GyQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wvl6kwbseajejlt5cxla.jpg","description":"Alpha 27, the one planet in the galaxy that is fit for human habitation.

The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police.  Overview Download is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace.  Download is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2.  Gameplay Syd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout.  The player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101026,"name":"DOWNLOAD","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":[],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":""},{"first_release_date":"10/26/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lrg.jpg","description":"A platformer where the player controls a small girl with an egg in her backpack, which can turn into a dragon.

The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).  With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \"That's Galactic Dancin'!\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \"secret bonus\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \"special bonus\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.  Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \"Warp Capsule\".  At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \"continue\" option to \"on\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101043,"name":"Galaga '88","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"03/27/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bvfxylxp8eaqwvas1rtc.jpg","description":"Multiplayer golf for the PC Engine courtesy of Masaya and Dual.

It was ported to the PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by Taito and was released on December 22, 1989. There was also a Mega Drive port by Toho entitled \"Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special\" released on December 26, 1990. The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up.  Set in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, \"Le Tau\", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a \"Heavy Unit\", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.  The player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies. There is at least one hidden bonus in every level of the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101051,"name":"Heavy Unit","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1988","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qs0zlk1u8cyyhfqiccpa.jpg","description":"On a fateful day in 20XX, the Earth's moon exploded into four large fragments and a multitude of meteors.

In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain. It also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels. Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade.

The goal of the game is to race to the end of each stage, avoiding other vehicles on the road and employing KITT's turbo boosters to make time, and then taking out the criminal Michael was sent to chase down with KITT's weaponry.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101060,"name":"Knight Rider Special","extraData":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Knight Rider Special","details":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"id":"tg1630","igdbId":42058,"gbId":51753,"gbGuid":"3030-51753","tgdbId":33988,"isExclusive":[{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Racing","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Adventure"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1989","esrb":"E","videos":["R1a5OwxOfZw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bcuyklxi81n3luy4mpnu.jpg","description":"Legend of Hero Tonma (レジェンド・オブ・ヒーロー・トンマ?) is a side scrolling platform game released by Irem to arcades in 1989.","story":"The player controls a caped hero named Tommy in his quest to rescue a princess.

It was originally released to the Arcade before being ported to the PC Engine and Sharp X68000. It would also be added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.  The Arcade and Sharp X68000 versions use an isometric view while the PC Engine uses a standard overhead view. The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed \"shabon balls\", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.  The enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else \"time over\" monsters will appear and attack her. The PC Engine version of the game lacks a time limit.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101066,"name":"Marchen Maze","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"07/11/1991","videos":["VZWqpdKqFAA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/erbipmwt0mjzfkgqx19k.jpg","description":"A cyberpunk multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine.

It was released by Hudson for the PC Engine in Japan on November 17, 1989. It was then released by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16 in North America in 1990. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service worldwide for the Wii in 2007 and in Japan for the Wii U on April 16, 2014; it was re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.  Neutopia is widely regarded as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings – which include long passwords, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior over the 1987 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called Neutopia one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101073,"name":"Neutopia","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure","Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Adventure, Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"09/26/1991","total_rating":80,"videos":["yqXbmHe5v6k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2iv9.jpg","description":"Jazeta brought peace back to the land.

In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.  The penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.  As in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101082,"name":"Pac-Land","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"02/14/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vi7hjy8ertcqxwfgz3gj.jpg","description":"Break out the bandages and get ready for some finger-searing action!

Home computer ports were handled by Ocean Software; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. An Apple IIgs port was completed in 1990, however was never commercially released (a leaked copy was however circulated). A clone for the PC, Brix, was released by Epic MegaGames in 1992. The Japanese arcade and FM Towns version has adult content during game play; a naked woman is revealed at the end of the level.  Puzznic bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Flipull/Plotting. An indie remake was made in 2009 for iPhone, called Gem Panic, and a range of Puzznic clones called 'Puzzle Magic' have appeared on mobiles. Many games share the same basic gameplay of Puzznic but have added extra features over the years:- Puzztrix on the web and on PC, Addled and Germinal on the iPhone, Puzzled on mobile phones.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101100,"name":"Puzznic","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Strategy, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1987","total_rating":77,"esrb":"E","videos":["P-WPX4AsvOE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ee.jpg","description":"R-Type is set in the 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a \"Arrowhead\", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the 'R' series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The R- in the series title originally stood for \"ray\", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type. his was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\".  The original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN's Top 10 most difficult games to beat. The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot 'em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a 'correct' way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level. The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable 'force' pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).","story":"This is the story of the first encounter with the Bydo, taking place in the year 2163.

Several hostages are being held in each stage; Joe must rescue all of them before he is allowed to finish the stage. The last stage in each mission has no hostages, but instead features a powerful boss character whom Joe must defeat. After completing each of the first four missions the player is taken to a bonus stage, where he can earn an extra life if he is able to kill all of the ninjas leaping towards him. Completing the fifth mission ends the game. Also, once the fifth mission begins, continues are no longer allowed; the player has to finish the game with however many lives he has left at that point. If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.  Joe's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi's shurikens.[4]  Joe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.  At the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player's score.","story":"The player controls a ninja named Joe Musashi who has to stop a criminal organization called \"Zeed\" who are kidnapping the children of his ninja clan.

Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\"PS\") and Mind Force (\"MF\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church.  Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases).

Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.  The goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.  Son Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101122,"name":"Son Son II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1985","total_rating":62,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ff.jpg","description":"Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens.

It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.  is the first update to the game. The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four.  Champion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity. One in particular is Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition.

The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.  The NES version of the game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.  The gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Sea Duck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.","story":"This game involves the adventures of Baloo and Kit delivering cargo for Rebecca Cunningham. However, Shere Khan wants to put Rebecca out of business, so he hires the Air Pirates, led by Don Karnage, to do his dirty work. \n \nIn the NES and Game Boy games, Baloo has to deliver his cargo across the world while fighting the pirates who are trying to stop him. Players control Baloo in his plane The Seaduck, except upon entry to a bonus level, where the player then controls Kit on his airfoil.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101133,"name":"Disney's TaleSpin","extraData":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"TaleSpin","details":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"id":"tg1649","igdbId":8067,"gbId":48591,"gbGuid":"3030-48591","tgdbId":707,"isExclusive":[{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform"},{"first_release_date":"10/19/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lzo5x2b5qxltj8prpayo.jpg","description":"A side-scrolling platformer featuring a bizarre cast of characters created by manga artist Akira Miyashita.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101134,"name":"Tatsu no Ko Fighter","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"},{"first_release_date":"08/23/1992","videos":null,"description":"Tatsujin is a vertical shooter by Taito and conversion of Toaplan arcade game originally released in 1988.

While moving around this edge the ship is protected from the aliens by a shield indicated by a glowing circle around the ship. This shield is not infinite and care should be taken to complete each level as quickly as possible. A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the 'Shield Line' or not.The idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the 'Laser Cutter' and moving off the 'Shield Line' and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.When you rejoin the 'Shield Line' the area that does not contain the 'Boss' alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the 'Shield Line' will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in. This percentage starts at 80% but may increase in the later levels.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101153,"name":"Volfied","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"06/18/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xtaqgwasypeufg8utemk.jpg","description":"Wai Wai means many people making noise so obviously this is a 4 player Mahjong game playing against many different characters.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101154,"name":"Wai Wai Mahjong","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Quiz/Trivia"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle, Quiz/Trivia"},{"first_release_date":"03/02/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/smrmvskqvwwvig2hdfb0.jpg","description":"A golf sim from Data East for the PC Engine.

Up to four human players can play, though because of the nature of golf, each player takes alternating turns depending on their distance from the hole. The game has many similar features to golf games of this era - the player can select which club to use, whether or not to hit the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as possible.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101155,"name":"Winning Shot","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Golf"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Golf"},{"first_release_date":"02/23/1987","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/q6pzk6pj0lrxyjlv2xpb.jpg","description":"Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.  As Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.  The game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101156,"name":"Wonder Momo","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gp0igxmsbtvfuofqm159.jpg","description":"This game belongs in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Overview: Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural is a 1989 PC Engine game that follows a family of cow anthropomorphs as they cultivate their home of Moo Cow Island. It uses a real-time strategy format where players explore the island and plant various crops. They must also fight off the occasional monster attack from the nearby volcanos, and clear the resulting toxic ash away.  The game is thought to be derived from an educational kid's TV show about agriculture shown in the Hokkaido region. Fans have observed the similarity of Daichikun's family and companions and those featured in the TV show, and the similar theme of farming in a harsh climate.  Gameplay: The player controls the oldest son of the family, the titular Daichikun, and his family members Hokkaido (grandpa), Suzuran (mama), Oozora (little brother), Marimo (little sister) and their friends Goro the bear and Alice the crow are all AI controlled and will follow the player until they find themselves a task to complete. Daichikun can use the flying \"Geiger No\" vehicle to move around and clear ash away quickly, though it cannot attack.  Additional factors unlock as the player progresses with the game, like a port town and various power-ups. The game is on a fast seasonal cycle - a minute represents a month - and various crops do better (or worse) depending on the time of the year.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101178,"name":"Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Real Time Strategy (RTS), Simulator, Strategy"},{"first_release_date":"01/13/1991","videos":null,"description":"A fighter plane shoot 'em up first released to the Arcade by Taito.

The player controls the eponymous Hani, a sentient haniwa figurine, as they shoot down legions of demonic spirits and youkai in the air. He is set to this task by ancient Japanese deity Izanagi, with the ultimate goal of rescuing his wife/sister deity Izanami.  The chief feature of Hani in the Sky is the protagonist's ability to change the direction of their weapon, allowing the player to shoot in eight different directions total. This is often required to defeat enemy waves emerging from all sides of the screen as well as the fast-moving bosses. The player can also upgrade Hani's weaponry, allowing him to fire in more directions simultaneously, as well as purchase health refills and other useful items from Izanagi.

After Hanii's exploits in Hanii in the Sky, the little Haniwa clay doll is back on a new mission. This time around, our cute friend must free the world from all the demons and other evil creatures that escaped from the Gods' realm. But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses.

The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.  Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.  Makai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.  Unlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101218,"name":"Makai Hakkenden Shada","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"12/20/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/i1o3kjiuut2yy9t5li27.jpg","description":"A side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring a magical demon prince.

The game is an arcade action title, but is unusual in that there are three distinct segments of gameplay, each of which affects the one following it.  In the first segment, Illuminar stands fixed in the middle of the screen. Moving the joystick controls his \"wisp\", a magical boomerang-like device. Pressing the fire button plants a seed that will slowly grow into a tree in several stages to adulthood. Ogres appear from both sides of the screen, walking across it horizontally. If they walk over an immature tree, the tree shrinks back one stage of growth, eventually disappearing. Spiders periodically appear and move randomly about the screen. If they move over a fully grown tree it becomes poisoned, and will eventually die. Both enemies can be vanquished by touching them with the wisp, which will also cure poisoned trees. Eye-Pods containing additional seeds periodically appear and can be picked up with the wisp. The speed of the action increases continually through the level until it becomes quite hectic at the end.  Every tree that survives the first level becomes Illuminar's ally in the second. Here the player enters a five-level side-view map of a crypt filled with spider eggs. Using the wisp, the player selects trees and moves them over the coffins where their roots grow into the roof of the coffins and eventually break through to crush the eggs lying below. If they take too long, the spider will hatch and attack the trees until the wisp kills them. Periodically the Hands of Fate descend from the roof, picking up anything below them and sometimes dropping prizes. The player must move through the crypt while all of this takes place, capturing question-mark prizes in order to extend ladders needed to reach lower levels. On this level, moving the joystick normally moves Illuminar, but holding down the fire button freezes him in place and moves the wisp instead.  The final confrontation between Illuminar and Tetragorn takes place in a graveyard. Gravestones appear that must be destroyed by walking over them in order to prevent Tetragorn from appearing. When he does - and there are always enough gravestones to ensure this - he shoots off trails of fire that injure Illuminar as he moves about. Any spider eggs that were not destroyed in the crypt also turn into spiders that attack Illuminar. The wisp can be used to banish either enemy, although while it is in use, Illuminar remains fixed in place.  Each hit by any enemy on Illuminar reduces his power and eventually kills him, although the periodic appearance of small rings of power will improve his life power again.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101230,"name":"Necromancer","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade","Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Arcade, Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"09/06/1992","videos":["PTWPVk5j79E"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/d1hhlyefnx2ofysgavqi.jpg","description":"Nekketsu FC is referred to as a weak team, but now we were finally supposed to play the national tournament.

Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the PC Engine with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.The controls are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship's movement, and the shot button fires the ship's main beam. The other button is used to equip or unequip Force; the series' most unusual innovation. Pressing down the shot button causes the blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending on the length of time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.Unlike the normal beam that only travels in a straight line, the newly added Shotgun Laser beam explodes in multiple directions after traveling a short distance. This shot causes heavy damage if the player can target a single enemy with it. However, holding the button down after the gauge is flashing causes the beam to return to the normal transverse beam (the gauge alternates between flashing and returning to the normal state while the button is held down), so the player must release the button at the right timing in order to successfully target enemies. The other newly added beam, the Search Laser, is semi-homing, and can bend at angles up to 45°.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101245,"name":"R-Type II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ozugodugr6iti7w7kvcc.jpg","description":"Chase H.Q.

The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.  The game includes five levels. As both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are just 60 seconds, the game is very short - a player who is able to finish the game on one credit will enjoy at most ten minutes of game-play.  Interestingly enough when Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio the frequency is always 144.X (various)Mhz. This is actually the 2-meter band of amateur or ham radio frequencies.  Although superficially similar in technology to Sega's Outrun, Chase HQ features significant technical advancements over that title in the presentation of perspective, hills and track splits.","story":"The player assumes the role of a police officer named Tony Gibson, member of the \"Chase Special Investigation Department.\" Along with his partner, Raymond Broady, he must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101252,"name":"Chase H.Q.","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Arcade"},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cdjop3zrpxjahkmxzugc.jpg","description":"Tenseiryuu: Saint Dragon (天聖龍 SAINT DRAGON?) is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game originally released as a coin-op by Jaleco in 1989.[1] It was converted to several home computer platforms by Storm Entertainment in 1990.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101253,"name":"Saint Dragon","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, SHMUP"},{"first_release_date":"03/22/2009","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xiryzs3f8vjkb8icnv3t.jpg","description":"Scale a skyscraper to rescue your lost love in The Tower of Druaga, the well-loved arcade classic!","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101254,"name":"Tower Of Druaga: Tower Of Defender","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Action","Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Action, Role-playing (RPG)"},{"first_release_date":"10/31/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kvw4rhhkqjmghfoox99w.jpg","description":"A stock-trading simulation game for the PC Engine.

It is a sequel to a 1986 Family Computer title titled Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu, also released exclusively in Japan.  The first player controls the eponymous Valkyrie who is not an actual Valkyrie from Norse mythology, but a warrior maiden from the heavens who happens to be named after them, while the second player controls Kurino Sandra, a green lizard who, despite his name, is actually male.  They must fight their way through eight multi-scrolling stages by firing shots from their sword (Valkyrie) and trident (Sandra) - and most of the enemies will leave gold coins or magic bubbles behind when killed, which can be exchanged for special items with Babasama and Zoul.  To answer the Nazonazo Phantom and Sphinmoth's questions on the fourth and seventh stages, a knowledge of the two Japanese syllabic writing systems (Hiragana and Katakana) is also essential; if a player does not know, they can only guess.  Also, if a player wants Babasama to teach them the \"Chameleon\" spell on the fifth stage, they shall have to walk up to a woman in one of the previous stage's interior areas, and speak to her so that she will give them a letter - without it, they cannot give it to Babasama, and he will not teach them the spell as a result. The clock tower at the end of the first stage also looks like a miniature Big Ben.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101257,"name":"Valkyrie no Densetsu","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure","Action"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"genresDisplay":"Adventure, Action"},{"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/juotyci8m8hu1xh38zgw.jpg","description":"A Japanese PC Engine exclusive horizontal shoot 'em up.
