The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...  The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100000,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":1644,"name":"James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing","first_release_date":"11/16/2003","total_rating":77,"esrb":"T","genres":["Shooter","Sport","Adventure"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21s1.jpg","description":"Returning as James Bond is Pierce Brosnan, who will lend his cyberscanned likeness and voice to the character.

Additionally, it features many elements of earlier Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the jet pack from Thunderball (1965) and the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964).From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor.

The game marked Pierce Brosnan's fourth appearance as James Bond before the release of his fourth and final Bond film Die Another Day. His likeness was featured in the game, but not his voice, which was provided by Maxwell Caulfield. Overall there are many weapons that the player can carry including grenades of various sorts and other types of explosives. In addition, there are numerous amounts of mounted weapons found throughout the game. As with previous James Bond games, the weapons that appear are based on actual weapons, but with the names changed. Some weapons appear in the console version but not the PC version, and vice-versa.","story":"The game's prologue mission starts in Paris, France, with James Bond helping French Intelligence operative Dominique Paradis evade a gang chase while chasing a truck with a stolen nuclear weapon, before continuing in his car. After stopping the truck from blowing up the Eiffel Tower, Dominique and James celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\nThe British Government sends Bond undercover to a party in industrialist Raphael Drake's Austrian castle. M believes that the party is a cover for the exchange of a missile guidance chip between Raphael Drake and Alexander Mayhew, who manages the Japanese branch of Drake's industry, Phoenix International, and had stolen the chip from the United States. Phoenix is believed to be a front for weapon smuggling. M gives Bond the instruction for 007 to rendezvous with CIA agent Zoe Nightshade and Dominique, who is posing as Drake's mistress. While Zoe distracts the guards, Bond makes his way to the exchange and steals the chip. Agents Nightshade and 007 make an try to make an escape on a cable car, when Drake's bodyguard, Rook, attacks the cable car with a rocket-launching helicopter. Bond shoots down the attacking helicopter using rockets found in the cable car. James and Zoe then escape Drake's forces in an armored snowmobile before continuing in James' car. They rendezvous with Q, who takes them out of Austria.\n\nAfter the breach, Drake threatens to kill Mayhew, should the operation fail. Mayhew contacts MI6, saying he will provide vital information if Bond comes to his rescue. At his Japanese estate, Mayhew is attacked by Drake's men, consisting of Japanese thugs. Bond fights his way through the estate and manages to obtain a file from Mayhew's safe. As they are prepared to make an escape from the estate, Mayhew is killed by a ninja. The file leads Bond to Mayhew's office at the Phoenix Building in Tokyo.\n\nBond is able to infiltrate the building while the guards are changing shifts and secures official NightFire documents. He is then attacked by Drake's men before Dominique provides a distraction, which allows Bond to escape via parachute off the roof of the building.\n\nThe NightFire documents lead Bond to a nuclear power plant being decommissioned by Phoenix International. Bond retrieves evidence of Drake's activities and escapes. However, he is then double crossed and captured by Kiko, Mayhew's former bodyguard, and turned over to Drake. On the top of the Phoenix building, Drake plans to kill Bond and Dominique, who has been discovered as a mole. Dominique is kicked off the rooftop and killed by Kiko. Bond escapes to the ground level before being saved by Australian Intelligence agent Alura McCall.\n\nM sends Bond and Alura to Drake's private island, where Drake has set up a jamming signal. The pair infiltrate the island and eliminate Drake's defenses. M makes Bond aware of the UN, EU, and NATO forces arriving on the island to dismantle remaining enemy combatants. Bond makes his way to Drake's underground silo, fighting off Kiko before entering one of three space shuttles intending to capture the Space Defense Platform. Kiko incinerates in the blast pit when Bond's space shuttle launches. Bond reaches the U.S. Space Defense Platform, where Drake is. He successfully sends all eight missiles off course, saving millions of lives, and causes Drake's laser weapon to malfunction, leading to a huge explosion. Finally, Bond kills Drake. As the station goes up in flames, Bond blasts from an escape pod and goes back down to Earth, where M informs him that astronomers from around the globe are reporting \"unexpected meteor showers\" (which is actually the debris of the now-destroyed Space Defense Platform).","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100003,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":3774,"name":"1080° Avalanche","first_release_date":"11/27/2003","total_rating":70,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"videos":["DYwGPEOj7DI","ZNLWG8VHBHk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2eux.jpg","description":"1080° Avalanche is a snowboarding game for the Nintendo GameCube, developed by Nintendo's in-house development studio, NST, and published by Nintendo.

The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him.

Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties.

The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version.

A total of ten different venues are available, and one of the featured modes offers a storyline complete with soap opera-style drama to go along with the suplexes and body slams. Up to four players can compete in Single, Tag-Team, Handicap, or Battle Royale matches.  EA combines the game-making prowess of Aki and the boisterous characters from hip-hop's Def Jam Records. The result is Def Jam Vendetta, a curious concoction that just might have the goods to attract hardcore and mainstream gamers alike.

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","story":"The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location. \n \nThe chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story. \n \nIn 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100035,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"id":"ngc22","name":"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem","details":["Nintendo GameCube console exclusive"],"igdbId":3907,"gbId":7512,"gbGuid":"3030-7512","tgdbId":6970,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]},"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":3908,"name":"Evolution Skateboarding","first_release_date":"10/08/2002","total_rating":25,"esrb":"T","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/le9cr4bc5o5bisunimhk.jpg","description":"Evolution Skateboarding is a 2002 skateboarding video game released by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get. \n \nF-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off. \n \nFalcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil. \n \nAt his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible.

The player takes the role of an ex-MI6 agent Jack Hunter, who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger (a member of a powerful unnamed criminal organisation based on Ian Fleming's SPECTRE) to assassinate his rival Dr. No. Several other characters from the Bond series make appearances throughout the game, including Pussy Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp and Francisco Scaramanga.Despite its name and being part of the James Bond universe, the game has no relation to the 1995 film or the 1997 video game of the same name. In this setting the game's protagonist is given the name 'GoldenEye' after he loses his eye and receives a gold-colored cybernetic replacement.","story":"At the start of the game, a recording by M (head of MI6) reveals that: \"Three years ago, while on assignment, the agent was severely wounded in an encounter with Dr. No and subsequently lost the use of his right eye. Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6.\" According to the account, Dr. No shot the agent in his right eye during a mission.\nThree years after the incident that claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test and is held directly responsible for the \"death\" of 007. Charged with \"reckless brutality,\" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.\nThe agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at Auric Enterprises, where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename \"GoldenEye\"). Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At Hong Kong, GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the OMEN with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to Crab Key (Dr. No's base) with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.\nGoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the OMEN to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus that he can use to overload the OMEN.\nGoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the OMEN are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber that he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the OMEN, causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100045,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":3936,"name":"Gotcha Force","first_release_date":"11/26/2003","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E","genres":["Fighting","Shooter","Simulator"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fhc.jpg","description":"Collect hundreds of borgs and battle them out to save the day!

Before releasing the first Knockout Kings, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, Foes of Ali, for the 3DO in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.  The Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.  In Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.  In Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.  Knockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.  Knockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.  After Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100054,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":45139,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition","first_release_date":"11/06/2003","total_rating":80,"esrb":"","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"videos":["Hg5x80DOEo8","oInUKR4Y4Bo","otDmIiZxhPQ","cRNwL_GwXAw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25m1.jpg","description":"Receive Four Complete Classic Zelda games all on one disc when you buy the Zelda GameCube Bundle: The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II - The adventure of Link, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.

On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary.

Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection \"medikits\" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.  During missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100069,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":1728,"name":"Mega Man Anniversary Collection","first_release_date":"06/22/2004","total_rating":83,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"videos":["MvuMmEfiLjk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2050.jpg","description":"For 15 years, Mega Man games have appeared on consoles, and now you can play ten of them on one disc.

It was released in 2004 on both the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube, making it the second-to-last game in the Mega Man X series to be released. Unique to the series, it is an RPG featuring turn-based combat and an extensive story. It plays quite similarly to Capcom's signature Breath of Fire series in a number of ways, due to the shared development team. Chronologically, it is currently the Mega Man X game set furthest in the future, taking place sometime in the twenty-third century (22XX time period); however, it is also set in an alternate timeline outside of the main storyline of the Mega Man series.The Gamecube version let's you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater. The PS2 version contains a Mega Man X8 Demo.","story":"Prologue\nIn the year 22XX AD, a mysterious mineral known as Force Metal was extracted from the fragments of a meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean. Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.\n\nEverything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.\n\nAfter the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.\n\nChapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!\nX, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.\n\nUpon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100073,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":4004,"name":"Metal Arms: Glitch in the System","first_release_date":"11/17/2003","total_rating":77,"esrb":"T","genres":["Shooter"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wa8.jpg","description":"Metal Arms: Glitch in the System is a third-person shooter action-adventure video game, developed by Swingin' Ape Studios and released in 2003.

The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidström, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow[1] and Harry Teinowitz.  Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.

It is also the name of the first song on that album. Each song on the album is about a different classic arcade game, and uses sound effects from that game. The album was released as an LP, a cassette, an 8-track tape, and later completely re-recorded for CD release in 1999 and 2002. The title itself is a parody of “Cat Scratch Fever” by Ted Nugent.[2]  The title song, \"Pac-Man Fever\", was released as a single in December 1981 and became a top-ten hit, peaking at #9 in March 1982 on the Billboard Hot 100[3] and earning Gold certification by the RIAA for selling over a million records;[4] the single sold 2.5 million copies in total as of 2008.[5] It had been released independently earlier in the year on the BGO Records label, before being picked up by CBS. \"Do the Donkey Kong\" was the second single released from the album, but it failed to chart except on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles at #103. Like the title song, the album Pac-Man Fever itself went on to receive a Gold certification from the RIAA, for over 500,000 records sold;[6] the album sold 900,000 copies in total by the end of 1982. The duo performed both of these singles on American Bandstand on March 20, 1982,[7] as well as appearing later that day on Solid Gold,[8] singing \"Pac-Man Fever\".","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100086,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":4062,"name":"Pac-Man Vs.","first_release_date":"12/02/2003","total_rating":67,"esrb":"E","genres":["Puzzle"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dz8.jpg","description":"Pac-Man Vs. is a Pac-Man video game originally designed exclusively for the Nintendo GameCube that was included as an extra bonus disc with the Player's Choice edition of Pac-Man World 2.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100087,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":4063,"name":"Pac-Man World 2","first_release_date":"02/23/2002","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Racing","Adventure"],"videos":["0JCB_Hmzm5U"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1oy7.jpg","description":"Long ago, back in medieval times, an evil spirit known as Spooky had terrorized all of Pac-Land.

His relentless pursuit of unification with the neighboring United Republic has left the country soaked in unnecessary bloodshed and poverty. Propaganda is plastered throughout communities and a Public Information Building, built as a tribute to the self-centered chancellor, spews news broadcasts with claims of victory as more and more soldiers fall victim. Fed up after years on the front lines, a group of super-soldiers injected with nanotechnology vow to replace the dictator and restore peace.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed \"Alias\") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth. \n \nEventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \"The Processed\". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player's squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him. \n \nAlias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad's leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth's military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov's commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory's power generators. Alias's explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass. \n \nAlias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot's statue with the nanotech cell – the culmination of Capek's research – and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov's subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov's fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player's Heroics score.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100094,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":974,"name":"Resident Evil 4","first_release_date":"01/10/2005","total_rating":85,"esrb":"M","genres":["Shooter"],"videos":["2ORc25vZo54"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wk8.jpg","description":"Resident Evil 4 is a 2005 survival horror video game published and developed by Capcom.

Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself. \n \nVyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodara directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100100,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":7862,"name":"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle","first_release_date":"12/19/2001","total_rating":75,"esrb":"E10+","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"videos":["EU4CbUoPBi4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2v8j.jpg","description":"Sonic and company are back and better than ever in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for Nintendo GameCube.

The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoring ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostreinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. After an intense battle Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge's evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but at the collapse of the vortex of Inferno, both swords along with the azure Nightmare were sucked in a void and expelled in another place. Siegfried, recognizing his sins, set out on a journey of atonement. Still the blade held a strong bond, and every night it took control of the body and took souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight Nightmare returned. Around those times various warriors came into contact of the blade's remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge's ultimate survival after its defeat. Driven either to possess or destroy it, they join a new journey, while Nightmare begins his rampage, seeking souls to restore Soul Edge once again.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":32,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":32,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100107,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":4166,"name":"SpyHunter","first_release_date":"03/09/2002","total_rating":59,"esrb":"T","genres":["Racing"],"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p1e.jpg","description":"Released originally in 2001, Spy Hunter is a remake of the 1983 classic arcade game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100108,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":4174,"name":"SSX 3","first_release_date":"10/19/2003","total_rating":90,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport","Adventure"],"videos":["sMiq5Wi2dxs","4n2FWQSJWbA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1o4m.jpg","description":"Players can discover the open mountain in the newest version of the smash-hit SSX snowboarding franchise.

Although the player controls Fox for almost the entirety of the game, the first level of Star Fox Adventures involves playing as another fox called Krystal, who speaks another language, from a different planet called Cerinia.  Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.  Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.  Fox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.  Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.  To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.  Fox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.  In order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.  Prince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick.  As you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu.  There are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time.  The game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi.  It is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games.

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console.  Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.","story":"This game has a story that is only told in the Japanese version.

AiAi escaped from the spot, and got tired and fell asleep. In his dreams, AiAi was told in his dreams there is a paradise called \"Banana Island\" in the sky from the \"Grand Monkey\". But in order to go there, you have to go through a couple of traps and gimmicks. But the Grand Monkey taught AiAi a magical spell: \"Ei Ei Poo!\" That protects him from any danger. AiAi wakes up quickly, and as he says \"Ei Ei Poo!\", A big ball flies out of the sky He gets insides of it and flies high above the sky. Now, survive several traps and tricks, and aim for it! Banana Island! \n \nWhen the player completes the Master Stages (in which the setting is above Banana Island), if they play as AiAi, MeeMee, or Baby, they will be able to go to Banana Island and enjoy all the bananas it has to offer. However, if you play as GonGon, he will be locked out of the place in which the bananas are kept while the other monkeys enjoy the bananas inside.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-25","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via modded GameCube with GC Loader","createdAt":"04/25/2021","updatedAt":"04/25/2021","_id":100121,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"downstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo GameCube","consoleId":21}],"extraData":["Nintendo GameCube launch title"],"extraDataFull":{"id":"ngc76","name":"Super Monkey Ball","details":["Nintendo GameCube launch title"],"igdbId":2927,"gbId":7247,"gbGuid":"3030-7247","tgdbId":6780,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Nintendo GameCube","id":"ccl4","igdbId":21,"gbId":23,"gbGuid":"3045-23","tgdbId":2}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]},"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"id":2928,"name":"Super Monkey Ball 2","first_release_date":"08/24/2002","total_rating":71,"esrb":"E","genres":["Puzzle","Sport","Strategy","Pinball"],"videos":["ekm_ounBFDw","X73QJ_M6LDA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f3o.jpg","description":"The object of Super Monkey Ball 2 is to guide a monkey trapped inside a plastic ball through a maze to the goal.

There are punches, kicks, grapples and takedowns. There are also ways of making your opponent submit, or \"tapout\", to gain a victory.  You have the ability to perform combos, but these combos are realistic; you can perform a 1-2-3-4 punch combo, or a punch-punch-kick, or any variation of those.

The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.  All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.  When dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.  In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.  There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.","story":"Vicious predators from the far ends of the universe are invading our planet!

By collecting power ups and using fast reflexes, B.O.B. tries to find his way off the asteroid and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds. \n \nAt the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard. B.O.B., frustrated with his obnoxious date, declares \"That's the girl for me!\" and drives off in pursuit of the red female.

She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.  There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot. You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level. You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit. You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these. You are awarded points for each correct match.  When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice. This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.  Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left. On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up. This brings you to another magazine cover. You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover. Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.

One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason unconscious. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation. The parts from S.O.P.H.I.A. are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission. Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of S.O.P.H.I.A. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him.

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).  The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100280,"name":"Boxing Legends of the Ring","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Sport","Boxing"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/31/1993","total_rating":64,"videos":["_q0VNbyf7Vw"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2w16.jpg","description":"The release for the Super NES and Megadrive/Genesis releases were platforming action games that are identical to each other, but have a few alterations depending on the version.

The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.  Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.  Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.  Gameplay[edit] The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.

The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations.Cannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.","story":"Cannon Fodder is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates - destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion - at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition.\n\nThe player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games.[9] As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100298,"name":"Cannon Fodder","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Strategy","Top-down shooter"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":63,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qnf.jpg","description":"Captain America and the Avengers is an arcade game released by Data East in 1991.

Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe. \n \nThe game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them. Even though the resurrection of Dracula was a success, the vampire hunters defeated him, and his allies.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100302,"name":"Castlevania: Bloodlines","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":90,"videos":["LRkc0sIJh94"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zrp.jpg","description":"The year is 275 B.C.

However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100305,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1993","videos":["8hDFdRavC6k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cse9bfvt7i1pz1qmpydz.jpg","description":"This soccer game offers 32 national teams to play, with none of the players' names shown.

For many years, the people of these planets lived in harmony together with the seemingly more advanced Parcerians continually visiting the Senecans. However, something happened on Parceria: something caused the Parcerians to shut off all forms of communication, visitation and activity with Seneca. Over time, Parceria's environment died out, leaving only a planet-wide barren terrain. Hundreds of years have now passed and the current generation of Senecans see Parceria as nothing but a dead husk with the concept of life and companionship on it being mere, long forgotten legends. \n \nOne day, an enormous attack force flies from Parceria and attacks Seneca without warning. Confirmed to be the Parcerian Military, the invaders cripple Seneca's defense forces. Besides being well armed and equipped, the Parceria Military is also able to manipulate the wildlife to do its bidding through unknown means, ensuring no possible escape to safety. The desperate people of Seneca eventually discovered an ancient star fighter abandoned by the Parcerians called The Baldanders. Using its super-technology, the people of Seneca use the Baldanders in a counter-attack against the Parcerian invasion to destroy their main battleship: a large, mysterious warship known only as 'Mother.'","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100338,"name":"Curse","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Curse","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd49","igdbId":4448,"gbId":41031,"gbGuid":"3030-41031","tgdbId":20311,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1995","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dnb.jpg","description":"Based on the feature film of the same name.

However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree.

Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm.

Arriving in the Arctic after a long travel through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue who informs the dolphin the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn't know what causes the storms, he suggests Ecco find the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. The Asterite greets Ecco telling him though it has the power to aid him, the Asterite cannot because orbs from its body have been lost. The Asterite tells him to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, and use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans. \n \nEcco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals stored with information. From the library Ecco learns the origins of the storms, an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet, so every 500 years when the planets align, they use their technology to harvest the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex that ended when a beam struck Atlantis from space sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated she spits out Ecco's pod she ate and they make their quick escape back to Earth.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100400,"name":"Ecco the Dolphin","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd74","name":"Ecco the Dolphin","igdbId":5378,"gbId":9286,"gbGuid":"3030-9286","tgdbId":132,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qcyvdk1p51xbf4ca1th4.jpg","description":"ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game with both exhibition and playoff modes.

Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.  Defeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.  The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100451,"name":"Gadget Twins","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/25/1990","videos":["Xl_ZTiBxLGg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2n1f.jpg","description":"Gaiares is a horizontal-scrolling shoot em' up released for the Sega Megadrive/Genesis in 1990.

The space pirates Gulfer, led by the evil Queen ZZ Badnusty, plan to harvest the pollution to create weapons of mass destruction. The United Star Cluster of Leezaluth sends a warning to the Earth about their plans, stating that if they could not stop them, they would be forced to supernova Earth's sun, those destroying the planet as well as causing the extinction of the human race; before having to carry out the process themselves; but if they succeeded (to switch Queen ZZ Badnusty doubted), Leezaluth would use their technology to restore the Earth to its former beauty. Dan Dare (Diaz in the Japanese original), a young pilot from Earth was chosen to be the pilot of a new fighter ship to combat the Gulfer. The ship is armed with a powerful experimental weapon from Leezaluth called the TOZ System, which would be operated by Alexis, the emissary from Leezaluth.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100452,"name":"Gaiares","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Gaiares","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd95","igdbId":93373,"gbId":4900,"gbGuid":"3030-4900","tgdbId":4385,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/31/1988","total_rating":71,"esrb":"E","videos":["_oGa04cI6Hc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tlkhftcccvslhiuthxcb.jpg","description":"In Gain Ground, players control one of a set of characters at a time.

Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as \"middle ghosts\"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.","story":"The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie).

Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.  By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil magician that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack.  There are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level 1 to 5 twice.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.  Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. \n \nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100468,"name":"Golden Axe","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd104","name":"Golden Axe","igdbId":5565,"gbId":14351,"gbGuid":"3030-14351","tgdbId":209,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/26/1991","total_rating":78,"esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qgu.jpg","description":"Just UpdatedAll SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis titles now launch using the new SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis Interactive Hub, with all new features, UI and Steam Workshop Support!About the GameThe Lord of Darkness, Dark Guld, has arisen again.

The player can perform a variety of different attacks (punches, kicks, and finishing blows) depending on the position of an enemy. By pressing both buttons while surrounded by enemies, the player can perform a special attack that strikes every enemy around him. By pressing both buttons while holding the joystick upwards, the player will perform a longer jump.The player can procure weapons by destroying barrels and wooden crates or disarming certain enemies. There are a total of eight weapons which can be obtained: three melee weapons (a pipe, a sword and a whip), two throwing weapons (knives and hand grenades), and three firearms (a pistol, a machine gun, and a rocket launcher). The barrels and crates can also be picked up and thrown at enemies as well. When the machine gun or rocket launcher runs out of ammunition, these are still wielded by the player as melee weapons. The pistol, on the other hand, is thrown by the player after all of its bullets are used. The player can drop his current weapon by pressing down and attack while wielding it. If a weapon lies on the ground after a certain period, it will vanish completely.There are seven regular stages (called rounds) and a bonus game, for a total of eight stages. The locations include a city, a moving train, a boat, a jungle, a cavern, and the hideout of the poachers.

One of the four cardinal directions is used to choose the pitch, and again to aim it towards low, high, inside (towards batter), or outside (away from batter). The same directions are used to aim the swing when batting. When fielding after a hit, the defensive player closest to the ball will flash to show it is the one currently under control. The four directions are then used to throw to one of the four bases.  The game incorporates a pitcher perspective, often used in MLB broadcasts. There are also managerial options available. The player has a selection of pitchers to choose from. Each team member has his own statistics that affect his performance, and can be rearranged as desired. Prior to HardBall!s release, there were managerial baseball games available, such as Micro League Baseball but HardBall! was the first to integrate that aspect with the arcade control of the game action itself.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100483,"name":"HardBall!","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Baseball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","total_rating":90,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yh3rorxiygfuil2gyut4.jpg","description":"Scare the evil, greedy Sardinis out of their houses by turning everyday household objects into something scary, funny or just plain gross.

It is an early real-time strategy game, predating the genre-popularizing Dune II. Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy.  In Herzog Zwei, the player directly pilots a flying, transforming mech, a multi-role robot suited for utility and combat. Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (which are fairly basic: patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed. Tactical re-deployment (mission reassignment, vehicle repair) involves a great deal of micromanagement, due to the required involvement of the mech.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100489,"name":"Herzog Zwei","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Herzog Zwei","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive","Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"id":"smd110","igdbId":24073,"gbId":11439,"gbGuid":"3030-11439","tgdbId":486,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/15/1993","total_rating":69,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/am37yxsfam3wowihjflg.jpg","description":"High Seas Havoc, known in Japan as Captain Lang, was also for arcade machines running on a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis based cabinet.","story":"The story is about an anthropomorphic pirate seal named Havoc (Lang in the Japanese version), his young sidekick Tide (Land in the Japanese version), a girl named Bridget, and an evil pirate named Bernardo.

The game was developed and published by Domark and released in 1993.Armed with a pistol, the player controls James Bond through various side-scrolling enemy bases to rescue female hostages and arm a bomb placed at a strategic point to destroy the base. Along the way, Bond must battle numerous thugs and familiar bosses.The game is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond, his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens, thus making it Dalton's last appearance in a Bond game to date. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark. It was also the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel. Instead it featured an original storyline, albeit one featuring familiar villains including Jaws and Oddjob. Though the game's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders EA, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, Operation Stealth, included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the licence added for its North American release.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100517,"name":"James Bond 007: The Duel","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sq4oozb4fiqqdcxtd5az.jpg","description":"Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing.

The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.  A nefarious supervillain named \"Doctor Maybe\" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name \"James Pond\" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like \"License to Bubble\" (after Licence to Kill), \"A View to a Spill\" (after A View to a Kill), \"Leak and Let Die\" (after Live and Let Die) and \"From Three Mile Island with Love\" (after From Russia with Love).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100519,"name":"James Pond: Underwater Agent","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jdw.jpg","description":"Unlike the first game of the series, that was a mission-based game, and the second one, where your character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, James Pond 3 is a standard jump and run platform game.

Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.  Despite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful pot was a resounding \"pop\" and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such.

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).  Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100540,"name":"Joshua & The Battle of Jericho","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/01/1995","total_rating":48,"esrb":"T","videos":["eO2sPSY6_uc","OMhZyg2A514","sQexHWFIZkQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s0ljjre9kx2r0ofnkyuf.jpg","description":"Judge Dredd is an action video game for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear and Game Boy originally released in 1995.

VIC Tokai published a version for the Mega Drive in 1994.  Unlike its predecessors, Kick Off 3 had no involvement from lead programmer Dino Dini, and thus plays very differently to other games in the series, having a \"horizontal\" pitch as opposed to a \"vertical\" one. Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release. Dino Dini released his own football game around the same time for the Amiga titled Goal!, which made its way onto the Mega Drive as Dino Dini's Soccer.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100549,"name":"Kick Off 3: European Challenge","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Soccer"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"05/27/1992","total_rating":85,"esrb":"","videos":["vcOj1JeM6Pk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21v1.jpg","description":"Kid Chameleon is a 1992 platform game released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. The premise of the game is that the main character, Casey, can use masks to change into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as Chameleon Kid (カメレオン キッド Kamereon Kiddo?).  The game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on May 22, 2007; North America on May 28, 2007; and Europe on June 1, 2007. It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2. The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","story":"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100550,"name":"Kid Chameleon","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd130","name":"Kid Chameleon","igdbId":16035,"gbId":11175,"gbGuid":"3030-11175","tgdbId":2279,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"07/25/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ywr.jpg","description":"King Colossus is a top-down action role-playing game.

The Sceptre of Order rested safely in his hands, keeping at bay the forces of darkness that infested the world. Children were happy. Merchants prospered. Honest folks made honest livings. And nobody complained much.But far across the waters, Arech Dragonbreath, leader of the Dark Legions, looked enviously upon the wealth and splendor of the four continents. With the aid of great magic, Arech stole into the chambers of King Maximus and wrested the Sceptre from the grip of the sleeping King. He then released his evil forces, ordering his minions and lieutenants to seize the land in whatever manner they pleased (as long as it involved considerable amounts of pain and terror). Arech retired to his new lair on the four continents and waited for King Maximus’s certain resistance. The King and his forces, however, offered none. Fearing some kind of trickery, Arech peered into his prophetic crystal to see what Maximus was up to. The crystal showed the King lying in bed, his face pale and gaunt like death itself. Over the King stood a noble young knight with the strength and resolve of great leader. The King was speaking. \"Come here\" he gasped, \"I am weak and breath is a luxury. Please.\" He extended his hand and the great leader drew close. \"You must restore my kingdom. I, too, must be restored. I am tied to this land and as it dies, so do I. My days here are numbered. You must recover the Sceptre if I and my land are to live.\"Arech watched this exchange and quickly buried the Sceptre somewhere on the four continents. He draw a map of its location, then shredded it into 25 pieces. He gave one to each of his 16 villainous nobles, kept one for himself, and the other eight he hid with powerful artifacts around the four continents. Your time grows short, leader.

The player takes control of Aarzak (Kenshiro in the Japanese original), who fights against his enemies using his punches and kicks. Aarzak can attack while standing, jumping, and crouching, for a total of six basic attacks. In addition to his life gauge, Aarzak has a power-up meter that will gradually fill as he defeats enemies. When the meter reaches a certain point (depending on the stage), Aarzak will transform into a super-powered state, allowing him to perform rapid punches and kicks for the rest of the stage. The game's levels (with the exception of boss battles and maze stages) feature a time limit at the lower-right corner of the screen; but unlike other time limits, instead of killing the character immediately when it reaches, it will instead gradually drain the player's life gauge until the player completes the level.  The game is divided into four stages or chapters, each featuring several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk from one to side to the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps. The player will encounter various allies throughout the game that will increase Aarzak's offensive or defensive strength, or replenish their health. The game features several one-on-one encounters with bosses as well. The player must sometime complete levels in a certain order in order to finish a chapter.  'Last Battle' is also notorious amongst gamers for its harsh difficulty throughout.  The original Japanese version ist based on the Fist of the North Star mangas/animes.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","story":null,"player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100566,"name":"The Lawnmower Man","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/06/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yx3.jpg","description":"An evil wizard.

Character abilities:  All three Vikings (Erik, Baleog and Olaf) have three health points which they can lose by getting hurt by enemies or by falling from great heights, and the ability to carry and use items, mainly keys, bombs, and food (which restore health points). Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities:  Erik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet. Baleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\"). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance. Olaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider.

Summary[edit] The game takes place in a floating post-apocalyptic Japan. The player emerges in the middle of Tokyo's Akihabara district where the buildings have turned into ruins. Countless demons have managed to destroy cities everywhere and the people are all hiding underground. Getting home to the Shinjuku district will allow the player to uncover more of the plot. Mysterious artificats called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts) help to play a role in this invasion by a mysterious civilization.  Players must choose between five characters; each one having different strengths and limitations. The game is played from the first-person perspective and the battles are extremely random. The dungeons in the game are claustrophobic and should remind some games of Shin Megami Tensei. Players do not gain levels after earning so many experience points. Instead, they gain energy points to boost their statistics.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100603,"name":"Maten Densetsu: Senritsu no Ooparts","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","videos":["7F4_kzb_vzg"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ju7eyz8eddhswksrehvo.jpg","description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100604,"name":"Math Blaster: Episode One - In Search of Spot","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"02/24/1993","videos":["GwM4vzyfmOI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2s57.jpg","description":"A beat em'up/versus fighting game based on the MazinSaga manga by Go Nagai, which was in turn a spin-off of Nagai's original Mazinger Z.","story":"The video game is based on a manga created by Go Nagai. Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts. \n \nMazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger. \n \nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100605,"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","extraData":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter","details":["Sega Genesis exclusive"],"id":"smd142","igdbId":36947,"gbId":26959,"gbGuid":"3030-26959","tgdbId":635,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"09/22/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qnq.jpg","description":"McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure starring Ronald McDonald.

The game consists of six stages, with the first two stages and the final one covering events from the film, whereas Stage 3 to 5 are set before the events of the film and adapts key episodes from the TV show's second season (namely \"White Light\", \"Ninja Encounter\", and \"Power Transfer\"). The game's soundtrack, composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, features hard rock arrangements of Ron Wasserman's original TV themes.  The game contains a total of nine rangers: Tommy, Adam, Kimberly, Billy, Aisha, Rocky, Zach, Trini, and Jason. When selecting Jason, Zach, and Trini, the voice clips of Adam, Aisha, and Rocky are heard when calling out their respective Zord name as their morphing command. The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach. There are cinematic scenes in digitized form that are abridged from the movie and some from Season 2 of the show. Lord Zedd, Goldar, the Putty Patrol, and Oozemen appear as sub-enemies. Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, AC, and DC are renamed in this title as Sentinel Neck, Sentinel Ear, and Sentinel Ring respectively. Players also can fight the Ecto-Morphicons using Ninja Megazord or Falcon Zord (both by 2-Player mode; Thunder Megazord and Mega Tigerzord against the Sentinels).

Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","story":"NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.\nA key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine. While the game was powering back on, the player holds Up and all buttons on player 1 and Down and all buttons on player 2.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100650,"name":"NBA Jam","extraData":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"NBA Jam","id":"smd160","details":["Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title"],"igdbId":8995,"gbId":16928,"gbGuid":"3030-16928","special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis Team Player compatible title","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Sport","Basketball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/15/1994","esrb":"E","videos":["3JROy8CY8zQ","MmHq451JNRw","P6WaD41K4DE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ov7vvjuszdc0gtrljnj5.jpg","description":"The first of the NBA Live video games series.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.  The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100698,"name":"Pac-Attack","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"04/05/1994","total_rating":69,"videos":["SEYxgqnK27c"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sss.jpg","description":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, known in Japan as Hello! Pac-Man, is a side-scrolling adventure game \"sequel\" to Pac-Man. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. It was produced and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis systems, and was released on April 6, 1994 by Namco. The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac-Land, and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series, such as Pac-Man's family and a main villain commanding the ghosts. The Genesis version was not released in Japan or Europe.","story":"After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's, for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he takes on disgruntled baloon salesmen and disgruntled security guards to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.\nDuring the game, the player can direct Pac-Man to one of two video arcades where a conversion of the original Pac-Man (based on the NES version, but with 16-bit graphics) can be played. The player can also complete an optional side quest by collecting three missing cartridge pieces. Once completed, a bonus game is unlocked in the arcades – in the SNES version, the bonus game is Ms. Pac-Man, while in the Mega Drive/Genesis version, an exclusive game called Pac-Jr. is unlocked instead. Pac-Jr. is a graphic and level hack of Ms. Pac-Man, and not a conversion of the unauthorized arcade game Jr. Pac-Man. This was done because a Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man was already released prior to this game and Namco did not own the rights to Jr. Pac-Man at the time.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100699,"name":"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/29/1987","total_rating":80,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mu7.jpg","description":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.   GAMEPLAY: The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.  The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.  Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.  Delivering the papers The paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.   In Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. The primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.  Keeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.  The player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.  There are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.  Along the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.  A 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.   Training course Paperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker. The end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.   Finish line bug A bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.  Recapping the delivery The next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.  The game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.  Losing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"  The arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.   PORTS: Paperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.  Unlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.  More recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003. A Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.  Paperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.  An iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100704,"name":"Paperboy","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":58,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qxj.jpg","description":"You're a paper boy.

After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has been reduced to desert, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the \"biomonsters,\" a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia's flora and fauna. \n \nKeeping these creatures under control is the job of \"hunters\". During an investigation into such an outbreak, Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, learns of the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet's ecological crisis. The planet is in the process of returning to its original desert state as the climate and biosphere-controlling devices installed over a thousand years previous begin to fail. The reasons behind the malfunctions are clarified as the plot unfolds, relating directly to the events of Phantasy Star II. \n \nChaz and his allies connect the world's troubles to a cult leader called Zio, \"The Black Magician,\" whose aims appear to be total annihilation, not only of Motavia, but of the whole Algol solar system. The heroes stop Zio in order to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. However, it soon becomes clear that Zio is merely the vanguard to a much larger enemy, long buried in the past. The secrets of the Algol star system are revealed as Chaz and company discover both the nature of the threat to their worlds as well as the safeguards placed in a time long forgotten.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100713,"name":"Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"03/20/1989","total_rating":80,"esrb":"E","videos":["rP1slFegNv4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2i27.jpg","description":"Gameplay is similar to the original Phantasy Star, the first game in the series.

The player must defeat enemies in the overworld and in dungeons to advance in the game.  The game abandoned the first-person view that the first game used for dungeons and battles. Phantasy Star II instead uses a top-down perspective for exploration and a third-person view in battles.","story":"Somewhere deep within the Andromeda Galaxy lies the Algol Star System. The parent star, Algol (referred to as \"Algo\" by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm (\"Palma\"), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota (\"Motavia\"), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo (\"Dezoris\"), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet. \n \nOne thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic. Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the climatrol tower, the bio-systems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need. \n \nThe game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize (but who resembles Alis) is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota's capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the commander, the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission. \n \nThe first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with cat-like features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei's origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota's climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, bringing an end to Mota's Biomonster hazard. \n \nHowever, this sets another incident in motion: the exploding impact causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain's security robots and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler. \n \nThe group boards Mota's last plane to Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion. Upon reaching there, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf's past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the system, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable against the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides. \n \nIt is eventually revealed that Dark Force has been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo's resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends there on an open-ended note, with the outcome of the fight left unrevealed.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100714,"name":"Phantasy Star II","extraData":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"extraDataFull":[{"id":"smd185","name":"Phantasy Star II","igdbId":1232,"gbId":4492,"gbGuid":"3030-4492","tgdbId":678,"details":["Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game"],"special":[{"value":"Sega Genesis/Mega Drive black box grid game","forPlatform":{"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","id":"ccl14","igdbId":29,"gbId":6,"gbGuid":"3045-6","tgdbId":18}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"04/20/1990","total_rating":77,"esrb":"E","videos":["JVCDO2khgfY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hznnuruplld14i7zu9gl.jpg","description":"Just as you’re about to marry Maia, the mysterious woman you found on the shore, a winged dragon grabs her and disappears.

The problem is that there are not enough princesses to rescue or dragons to slay for all the heroes, so Rodrigo is currently unemployed. Another problem involves pirates who want to raid the city Smashville and create flying ships with magical gloomstones. Confronted with this situation, Rodrigo is very disillusioned. Just in time, the dwarf Ramil hires Rodrigo to find his wife Jasmin, who was captured by the pirates and is held in the city of Endavin.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Text"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100760,"name":"Rent-A-Hero","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Simulator"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1994","videos":null,"description":"ResQ is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive developed by Tempest Software and set to be published by Psygnosis.

The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.","story":"Much like other games from the same timeframe, such as Gunstar Heroes, the game's story varied between the Japanese language release and its English language counterpart.

The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy to restore peace to the galaxy. \n \nIn the English-language version, Oruto is omitted altogether. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100769,"name":"Ristar","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1987","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vndpo5pahnoezgh6arvv.jpg","description":"The objective of the game is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel.

Knowing the Pig Star had the power to destroy entire worlds, El Zebulos had it placed under a magic seal for safekeeping. The \"Key to the Seal\" would be guarded and passed down by El Zebulos, and his Royal Family. Generations into the future, the kingdom has been subject to attack by neighboring countries which wanted control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights were formed. These Warriors wore armor with Rocket Packs, wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills. \n \nAround this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age. Later on, a corrupt Rocket Knight by the name of Axel Gear fought and wounded Mifune as he tried to steal an ancient book, which contained the secrets of the rocket knights. Sparkster was appointed the new Rocket Knight leader and spent 10 years posing as an outlaw as he searched for Axel Gear, only to return to Zebulos and hear rumors about Axel Gear's return. \n \nBy now the Kingdom is under attack by the Devotindos Empire led by Emperor Devligus Devotindos; who is said to have the power of hypnosis. Sparkster finds that Axel Gear has kidnapped Princess Sherry in attempt to blackmail the king into surrendering The \"Key to the Seal\".

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.  The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.  A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100777,"name":"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Simulator","Sport","Baseball"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"11/17/1991","esrb":"RP","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nfy.jpg","description":"A terrorist group has taken out the world information flow and, as either a guy named Albert Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them.

Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit also has the option to attack, cast a spell, use an item, search (if adjacent to a treasure chest), or stay and do nothing, all of which end the unit's turn. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions, and the character's turn is able to continue. The order of the turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.  The player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.  All the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100827,"name":"Sorcerian","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/28/1988","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E","videos":["4B3Taj-GESc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gsm.jpg","description":"A call for help comes from deep in the universe.

They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost contact with a vessel patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols. \n \nImmediately upon beginning play, the Enterprise receives a distress signal, broadcasting on all frequencies. It was sent out by one Dr. T'Laris, a Vulcan geologist stationed on a planet in the Codis Mu system (Codis Mu VI), and in the message she notes that her dig site was recently attacked by Romulans, and that the assailants are still present. The Enterprise responds to her plea for help and sets a course to her dig site. \n \nAs the game progresses, the player learns more about the missing Romulan vessel's mission, and of the IFD. The Enterprise also makes contact with an alien race known as the Chodak, hostile mollusk-like creatures who constantly accost the Enterprise as it traverses known space gathering clues about the IFD. There are also mentions of a now-extinct race called the Senatorious who were the last race to possess the IFD; the reason it resurfaced is because the Senatorious understood that they'd been using the IFD for their own benefit at the cost of all other races, and judiciously decided to send it ten thousand years into the future, in the hopes that civilizations then could put the IFD to use for the mutual benefit of all races. There is one more race, the gaunt Eunacians, which are encountered only once and, after the Enterprise repairs their ship, tell Jean-Luc Picard of the IFD Trials and the Eunacians' intention to participate. However, with their ship crippled, and the rest of their race residing in the Gamma Quadrant, they entrust the Federation with recovery of the IFD, and its judicious use.","player_perspectives":["First person","Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100846,"name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Echoes from the Past","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/14/1986","total_rating":79,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jjh8brp8ii5nlfvdk4rr.jpg","description":"Starflight is a space exploration role-playing adventure video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986.

The player controls Hiryu himself, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.  Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively.  The game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","story":"Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the \"Grandmaster\" rules over the world.

The events are:  Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.  400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event.  High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.  Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from).

It incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called \"MF\" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player.  The game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their HP and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their \"Load Capacity\" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses cut scenes for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to Ys, a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.","story":"Many years after the events of Hydlide II, an explosion of flames appeared near The City of the Woods.

In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest. The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used. The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100876,"name":"Sword of Vermilion","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/19/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kkggvmy3xb2mc0svuf24.jpg","description":"Yuko Ahso looks like an ordinary grammar school student, but she is actually the Valis Warrior.  \"I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Valis sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process\" Yuko went home by train after that terrible fight.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

It is the second entry in the Test Drive series of video games.","story":"Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent. \n \nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course. \n \nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left. \n \nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player’s car, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn’t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100905,"name":"The Duel: Test Drive II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1984","total_rating":87,"videos":["rUCN84SviLc","Ql81jI4DpgQ","uRrTA8NqPpQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ufk.jpg","description":"Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game.

Knowing this, the Galaxy Federation creates the FIRE LEO-03 Styx; a craft small enough to avoid detection by Cerberus, yet equipped with the firepower of a large starfighter.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth. The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction. Since its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\".","story":"The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth.

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.  You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks.

Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan's earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.  Another draw of Twin Hawk is the game's unique \"smartbomb\" in the form of a group of friendly planes; pressing button 2 once will call in six Flying Fortresses to surround and protect the player's plane, and provide back-up fire. They are easily taken down by enemy fire, so the player must use them wisely.  Pressing button 2 again immediately after the call-in will sacrifice the planes for a more typical smartbomb. Otherwise, pressing button 2 while any other plane is on-screen will suicide them all into the nearest enemies below.","story":"At the end of an alternate World War II, a new European country is formed called Gorongo. General Giovanni of the Gorongo military was infuriated with the results of the war and what it meant to the country of Gorongo, initiating a rebellion against the country’s government that was widely followed by his soldiers. Holing themselves up on Bobo Island, south of Gorongo, Giovanni declared the occupation as the independent state of Fuangania and plotted to take over Gorongo. After taking over the town of Kusunoki, the Fuangania invasion – consisting of massive ground and sea attack forces – started to spread. \n \nGorongo President Bratt ordered a counterattack that focused on the one type of firepower Giovanni lacked: an air force. The special air force \"Daisenpuu\" sets up a mountain base after spotting a secret Fuangania fortress under construction. However, nearing the end of their training, the airforce is spotted by the Fuangania and are preparing to attack. It's up to the player, in the role of the Wing Commander, to fly into Giovanni's secret base and take him and his commanding unit out.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100939,"name":"Twin Hawk","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/23/1992","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gnez34teoaph8mu0xuam.jpg","description":"In the darkness preceding the creation of the world Alpherion, three lights (red, green, and blue) were created.

While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile. \n \nEach player has a life bar, which decreases each time they're hit. Some enemies can grab onto the players and drain their life. A player loses a life when his life bar reaches zero. If the hit that finishes a player is an explosion or flame, he slumps to the ground burnt. The life bar can be fully refilled between stages, with a cut scene showing the player(s) punching a \"Power Cola\" vending machine causing sodas to fall out which they drink, those vending machines also featured in most stages as replenishment points.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100941,"name":"Two Crude Dudes","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Fighting","Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/05/1995","total_rating":69,"esrb":"M","videos":["eF3FmhDs9Q0","zPFJ9RZITjs"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y06.jpg","description":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more.

Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.  Every jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via Mega Everdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100954,"name":"Vapor Trail","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis","consoleId":29}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/23/1995","total_rating":80,"esrb":"","videos":["NcL_kM9twZk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2k56.jpg","description":"By the year 2049, Earth has been turned into a toxic waste dump.

Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828.  In 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music.  The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.  As in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.  There are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100976,"name":"1943: Kai","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/15/1994","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s632aabjde3m82yllvqq.jpg","description":"A property-trading board game featuring aliens, robots and other unusual characters.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100977,"name":"21 Emon: Mezase!

Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.  Control of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons.

It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.  The four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100984,"name":"Atomic Robo-Kid Special","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xhepihwsnb92w6ewxoyh.jpg","description":"Forget the movies.

To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped.

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.  Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.  The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100998,"name":"Bonk's Revenge","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1993","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ogn.jpg","description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":100999,"name":"Bonk III: Bonk's Big Adventure","extraData":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Bonk III: Bonk's Big Adventure","id":"tg168","details":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"igdbId":12493,"gbId":11312,"gbGuid":"3030-11312","special":[{"value":"TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title, TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player","forPlatform":{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"03/15/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yn8.jpg","description":"The player controls a worker in a warehouse.

In Japan, Boxyboy is known as Sokoban World and is an official part of the Sokoban series.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101000,"name":"Boxyboy","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":[],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/faouzfrjy67km0iy2ztd.jpg","description":"The village of Nitta has been invaded by the army of Dr. Bomb, an evil scientist who is plotting to take over the world.

The anime/game is set in the near future of 2032, which has seen Tokyo split into two by a massive earthquake. Corporations rule the country, production-line humanoid robots named \"boomers\" are being used by villains to commit crimes, and the beleaguered police are too under-budgeted and incompetent to handle it all. The all-female mercenary team the Knight Sabers, who use powerful exosuits called \"Hard Suits\", are the city's best defense.  The game operates similarly to other adventure games of the era. The player is given a selection of commands that they can use to interact with the world, including talking to NPCs, picking up and using objects in their inventory and moving to other areas. At any time the player can look and listen for extra context clues. The commands are in English, but the game's story and dialogue text is entirely Japanese. The game will occasionally switch protagonists, starting with Nene Romanova and moving to Priss, Linna and Sylia at various points.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101003,"name":"Bubblegum Crash","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/07/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yywnueqky3hf2hskxefw.jpg","description":"A PC Engine boxing game with an alternate brawler mode.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101004,"name":"Bullfight Ring no Hasha","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/06/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dwfk33qdmsqzq68sgqoh.jpg","description":"Evil forces have kidnapped the leader of the Burning Project!

Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link's gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.Four characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.There are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash. The environments differ significantly, from pleasant meadows to caves, and from forests to underwater environments. Some foes encountered in these levels are derived from common mythology while others are completely made up for the game.","story":"The game setting is a medieval fantasy world similar to that of the high fantasy seen in The Lord of the Rings. The demons and abominations of nature who reside in the underground kingdom of Cadash have not forgotten that, thousands of years previously, they once shared the light with humans. Then one rose among them who was especially powerful, a demonic wizard born of a human woman – the Balrog (Baarogue or Baalogue in the arcade version, and Barlog in the TurboGrafx version). The Balrog promised his followers they could, in time, emerge from their subterranean prison and rule the world of men, taking revenge on humans for their prior defeat in battle and subsequent exile, if the Balrog could mingle his blood with that of a human king. The Balrog and his demonic armies gathered in force over the centuries, and are now powerful enough to emerge to the surface and make war with the unprepared human kingdoms which had not known war for millennia, all of which quickly fall to the Balrog. The human world is almost entirely laid to waste by the Balrog. However, this was not enough for the Balrog, whose prize is the mightiest of all human kingdoms, the Kingdom of Dirzir. One night, the beautiful Princess Salassa is kidnapped by the Balrog from the Keep of Deerzar, the capital city of Dirzir, and taken underground to the dreaded Castle Cadash. There the Balrog plans to initiate the ritual which would magically bind himself to the human princess, becoming all-powerful and invincible. Dilsarl, the distraught and helpless elderly King of Dirzir, has vowed to give his entire kingdom to the one who would rescue his beloved only daughter, and many brave heroes have disappeared into the depths of Cadash on this quest.","player_perspectives":["Text"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101006,"name":"Cadash","extraData":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Cadash","id":"tg1610","details":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player"],"igdbId":6652,"gbId":18068,"gbGuid":"3030-18068","special":[{"value":"TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title, TurboGrafx-16 simultaneous 2 player","forPlatform":{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Fighting","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/13/1991","videos":null,"description":"Champion Wrestler gained popularity in the arcade, and now it is reborn on the PC Engine!

The basic idea is traditional: shooting everything before they can shoot/touch the player: after three hits the chitin armor breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb.  The player has the choice between four insect forms which are changed by collecting the associated extra symbols. Collecting more of the same symbol upgrades the insect, but this also rises the difficulty level. Other extras include smart bombs, extra lives, armor refreshments or a protection shield.

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.  Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.  Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101019,"name":"Cyber Knight","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1992","videos":["jRRX7jS4GyQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wvl6kwbseajejlt5cxla.jpg","description":"Alpha 27, the one planet in the galaxy that is fit for human habitation.

The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police.  Overview Download is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace.  Download is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2.  Gameplay Syd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout.  The player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101026,"name":"DOWNLOAD","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":[],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/26/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lrg.jpg","description":"A platformer where the player controls a small girl with an egg in her backpack, which can turn into a dragon.

The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).  With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \"That's Galactic Dancin'!\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \"secret bonus\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \"special bonus\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.  Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \"Warp Capsule\".  At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \"continue\" option to \"on\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101043,"name":"Galaga '88","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"03/27/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bvfxylxp8eaqwvas1rtc.jpg","description":"Multiplayer golf for the PC Engine courtesy of Masaya and Dual.

It was ported to the PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by Taito and was released on December 22, 1989. There was also a Mega Drive port by Toho entitled \"Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special\" released on December 26, 1990. The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up.  Set in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, \"Le Tau\", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a \"Heavy Unit\", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.  The player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies. There is at least one hidden bonus in every level of the game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101051,"name":"Heavy Unit","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1988","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qs0zlk1u8cyyhfqiccpa.jpg","description":"On a fateful day in 20XX, the Earth's moon exploded into four large fragments and a multitude of meteors.

The game features simulations of eighteen holes from renowned golf courses in the United States, Scotland, and England: Four from Augusta National Golf Club, three from Pebble Beach Golf Links, three from the Old Course at St Andrews, two from the Riviera Country Club, two from Baltusrol Golf Club, one from Oakmont Country Club, one from Merion Golf Club, one from Muirfield, and one from Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club. In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain. It also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels. Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade. The two companies developed it into a video game franchise, and Accolade published numerous adaptations and sequels for more than ten years.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101054,"name":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf","extraData":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 4 player"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf","id":"tg1627","details":["TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title","TurboGrafx-16 4 player"],"igdbId":18101,"gbId":15139,"gbGuid":"3030-15139","special":[{"value":"TurboGrafx-16 Multitap compatible title, TurboGrafx-16 4 player","forPlatform":{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}],"genres":["Simulator","Sport","Golf"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":70,"videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nbkwkc65hz7zkustfplp.jpg","description":"Jackie and his sister, Josephine, are tough on tyrants.

It was originally released to the Arcade before being ported to the PC Engine and Sharp X68000. It would also be added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.  The Arcade and Sharp X68000 versions use an isometric view while the PC Engine uses a standard overhead view. The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed \"shabon balls\", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.  The enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else \"time over\" monsters will appear and attack her. The PC Engine version of the game lacks a time limit.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101066,"name":"Marchen Maze","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"07/11/1991","videos":["VZWqpdKqFAA"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/erbipmwt0mjzfkgqx19k.jpg","description":"A cyberpunk multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine.

It was released by Hudson for the PC Engine in Japan on November 17, 1989. It was then released by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16 in North America in 1990. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service worldwide for the Wii in 2007 and in Japan for the Wii U on April 16, 2014; it was re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.  Neutopia is widely regarded as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings – which include long passwords, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior over the 1987 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called Neutopia one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101073,"name":"Neutopia","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Adventure","Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"09/26/1991","total_rating":80,"videos":["yqXbmHe5v6k"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2iv9.jpg","description":"Jazeta brought peace back to the land.

In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.  The penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.  As in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101082,"name":"Pac-Land","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"02/14/1991","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vi7hjy8ertcqxwfgz3gj.jpg","description":"Break out the bandages and get ready for some finger-searing action!

Home computer ports were handled by Ocean Software; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. An Apple IIgs port was completed in 1990, however was never commercially released (a leaked copy was however circulated). A clone for the PC, Brix, was released by Epic MegaGames in 1992. The Japanese arcade and FM Towns version has adult content during game play; a naked woman is revealed at the end of the level.  Puzznic bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Flipull/Plotting. An indie remake was made in 2009 for iPhone, called Gem Panic, and a range of Puzznic clones called 'Puzzle Magic' have appeared on mobiles. Many games share the same basic gameplay of Puzznic but have added extra features over the years:- Puzztrix on the web and on PC, Addled and Germinal on the iPhone, Puzzled on mobile phones.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101100,"name":"Puzznic","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/30/1987","total_rating":77,"esrb":"E","videos":["P-WPX4AsvOE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ee.jpg","description":"R-Type is set in the 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a \"Arrowhead\", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the 'R' series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The R- in the series title originally stood for \"ray\", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type. his was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\".  The original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN's Top 10 most difficult games to beat. The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot 'em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a 'correct' way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level. The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable 'force' pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).","story":"This is the story of the first encounter with the Bydo, taking place in the year 2163.

Several hostages are being held in each stage; Joe must rescue all of them before he is allowed to finish the stage. The last stage in each mission has no hostages, but instead features a powerful boss character whom Joe must defeat. After completing each of the first four missions the player is taken to a bonus stage, where he can earn an extra life if he is able to kill all of the ninjas leaping towards him. Completing the fifth mission ends the game. Also, once the fifth mission begins, continues are no longer allowed; the player has to finish the game with however many lives he has left at that point. If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.  Joe's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi's shurikens.[4]  Joe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.  At the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player's score.","story":"The player controls a ninja named Joe Musashi who has to stop a criminal organization called \"Zeed\" who are kidnapping the children of his ninja clan.

Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\"PS\") and Mind Force (\"MF\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church.  Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases).

Son Son 2 is the direct sequel to Son Son and features an interpretation of the Son Goku character from ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West. Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.  The goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.  Son Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101122,"name":"Son Son II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1985","total_rating":62,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ff.jpg","description":"Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens.

It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.  is the first update to the game. The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four.  Champion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity. One in particular is Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition.

The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.  The NES version of the game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.  The gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Sea Duck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.","story":"This game involves the adventures of Baloo and Kit delivering cargo for Rebecca Cunningham. However, Shere Khan wants to put Rebecca out of business, so he hires the Air Pirates, led by Don Karnage, to do his dirty work. \n \nIn the NES and Game Boy games, Baloo has to deliver his cargo across the world while fighting the pirates who are trying to stop him. Players control Baloo in his plane The Seaduck, except upon entry to a bonus level, where the player then controls Kit on his airfoil.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101133,"name":"Disney's TaleSpin","extraData":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":[{"name":"TaleSpin","details":["NEC Turbografx 16 exclusive"],"id":"tg1649","igdbId":8067,"gbId":48591,"gbGuid":"3030-48591","tgdbId":707,"isExclusive":[{"name":"NEC TurboGrafx 16","id":"ccl33","igdbId":86,"gbId":55,"gbGuid":"3045-55","tgdbId":34}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"10/19/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lzo5x2b5qxltj8prpayo.jpg","description":"A side-scrolling platformer featuring a bizarre cast of characters created by manga artist Akira Miyashita.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101134,"name":"Tatsu no Ko Fighter","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"08/23/1992","videos":null,"description":"Tatsujin is a vertical shooter by Taito and conversion of Toaplan arcade game originally released in 1988.

While moving around this edge the ship is protected from the aliens by a shield indicated by a glowing circle around the ship. This shield is not infinite and care should be taken to complete each level as quickly as possible. A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the 'Shield Line' or not.The idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the 'Laser Cutter' and moving off the 'Shield Line' and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.When you rejoin the 'Shield Line' the area that does not contain the 'Boss' alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the 'Shield Line' will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in. This percentage starts at 80% but may increase in the later levels.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101153,"name":"Volfied","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"06/18/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xtaqgwasypeufg8utemk.jpg","description":"Wai Wai means many people making noise so obviously this is a 4 player Mahjong game playing against many different characters.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101154,"name":"Wai Wai Mahjong","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Puzzle","Quiz/Trivia"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"03/02/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/smrmvskqvwwvig2hdfb0.jpg","description":"A golf sim from Data East for the PC Engine.

Up to four human players can play, though because of the nature of golf, each player takes alternating turns depending on their distance from the hole. The game has many similar features to golf games of this era - the player can select which club to use, whether or not to hit the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as possible.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101155,"name":"Winning Shot","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Sport","Golf"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"02/23/1987","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/q6pzk6pj0lrxyjlv2xpb.jpg","description":"Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.  As Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.  The game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101156,"name":"Wonder Momo","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Arcade"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/31/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gp0igxmsbtvfuofqm159.jpg","description":"This game belongs in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Overview: Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural is a 1989 PC Engine game that follows a family of cow anthropomorphs as they cultivate their home of Moo Cow Island. It uses a real-time strategy format where players explore the island and plant various crops. They must also fight off the occasional monster attack from the nearby volcanos, and clear the resulting toxic ash away.  The game is thought to be derived from an educational kid's TV show about agriculture shown in the Hokkaido region. Fans have observed the similarity of Daichikun's family and companions and those featured in the TV show, and the similar theme of farming in a harsh climate.  Gameplay: The player controls the oldest son of the family, the titular Daichikun, and his family members Hokkaido (grandpa), Suzuran (mama), Oozora (little brother), Marimo (little sister) and their friends Goro the bear and Alice the crow are all AI controlled and will follow the player until they find themselves a task to complete. Daichikun can use the flying \"Geiger No\" vehicle to move around and clear ash away quickly, though it cannot attack.  Additional factors unlock as the player progresses with the game, like a port town and various power-ups. The game is on a fast seasonal cycle - a minute represents a month - and various crops do better (or worse) depending on the time of the year.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101178,"name":"Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Real Time Strategy (RTS)","Simulator","Strategy"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"01/13/1991","videos":null,"description":"A fighter plane shoot 'em up first released to the Arcade by Taito.

The player controls the eponymous Hani, a sentient haniwa figurine, as they shoot down legions of demonic spirits and youkai in the air. He is set to this task by ancient Japanese deity Izanagi, with the ultimate goal of rescuing his wife/sister deity Izanami.  The chief feature of Hani in the Sky is the protagonist's ability to change the direction of their weapon, allowing the player to shoot in eight different directions total. This is often required to defeat enemy waves emerging from all sides of the screen as well as the fast-moving bosses. The player can also upgrade Hani's weaponry, allowing him to fire in more directions simultaneously, as well as purchase health refills and other useful items from Izanagi.

But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!).

The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.  Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.  Makai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.  Unlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101218,"name":"Makai Hakkenden Shada","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/20/1990","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/i1o3kjiuut2yy9t5li27.jpg","description":"A side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring a magical demon prince.

The game is an arcade action title, but is unusual in that there are three distinct segments of gameplay, each of which affects the one following it.  In the first segment, Illuminar stands fixed in the middle of the screen. Moving the joystick controls his \"wisp\", a magical boomerang-like device. Pressing the fire button plants a seed that will slowly grow into a tree in several stages to adulthood. Ogres appear from both sides of the screen, walking across it horizontally. If they walk over an immature tree, the tree shrinks back one stage of growth, eventually disappearing. Spiders periodically appear and move randomly about the screen. If they move over a fully grown tree it becomes poisoned, and will eventually die. Both enemies can be vanquished by touching them with the wisp, which will also cure poisoned trees. Eye-Pods containing additional seeds periodically appear and can be picked up with the wisp. The speed of the action increases continually through the level until it becomes quite hectic at the end.  Every tree that survives the first level becomes Illuminar's ally in the second. Here the player enters a five-level side-view map of a crypt filled with spider eggs. Using the wisp, the player selects trees and moves them over the coffins where their roots grow into the roof of the coffins and eventually break through to crush the eggs lying below. If they take too long, the spider will hatch and attack the trees until the wisp kills them. Periodically the Hands of Fate descend from the roof, picking up anything below them and sometimes dropping prizes. The player must move through the crypt while all of this takes place, capturing question-mark prizes in order to extend ladders needed to reach lower levels. On this level, moving the joystick normally moves Illuminar, but holding down the fire button freezes him in place and moves the wisp instead.  The final confrontation between Illuminar and Tetragorn takes place in a graveyard. Gravestones appear that must be destroyed by walking over them in order to prevent Tetragorn from appearing. When he does - and there are always enough gravestones to ensure this - he shoots off trails of fire that injure Illuminar as he moves about. Any spider eggs that were not destroyed in the crypt also turn into spiders that attack Illuminar. The wisp can be used to banish either enemy, although while it is in use, Illuminar remains fixed in place.  Each hit by any enemy on Illuminar reduces his power and eventually kills him, although the periodic appearance of small rings of power will improve his life power again.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101230,"name":"Necromancer","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Arcade","Role-playing (RPG)"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"09/06/1992","videos":["PTWPVk5j79E"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/d1hhlyefnx2ofysgavqi.jpg","description":"Nekketsu FC is referred to as a weak team, but now we were finally supposed to play the national tournament.

Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the PC Engine with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.The controls are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship's movement, and the shot button fires the ship's main beam. The other button is used to equip or unequip Force; the series' most unusual innovation. Pressing down the shot button causes the blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending on the length of time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.Unlike the normal beam that only travels in a straight line, the newly added Shotgun Laser beam explodes in multiple directions after traveling a short distance. This shot causes heavy damage if the player can target a single enemy with it. However, holding the button down after the gauge is flashing causes the beam to return to the normal transverse beam (the gauge alternates between flashing and returning to the normal state while the button is held down), so the player must release the button at the right timing in order to successfully target enemies. The other newly added beam, the Search Laser, is semi-homing, and can bend at angles up to 45°.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-04-10","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via TurboEverdrive","createdAt":"04/10/2021","updatedAt":"04/10/2021","_id":101245,"name":"R-Type II","extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[],"genres":["Shooter","Arcade","SHMUP"],"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine","consoleId":86}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false}},{"first_release_date":"12/30/1989","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ozugodugr6iti7w7kvcc.jpg","description":"Chase H.Q.

The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.  The game includes five levels. As both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are just 60 seconds, the game is very short - a player who is able to finish the game on one credit will enjoy at most ten minutes of game-play.

On the contrary, this all-or-nothing fight will have you accessing guns, grenades, launchers, and weaponry of all sorts. Players assume command of an army that's out to reclaim a world that's been broken up by warring factions. The battle map is essentially a grid, and moving units is like moving chess pieces on a board -- each of the units can move a specific amount of spaces within this grid, and can only attack at a certain distance from specific enemies. Advance Wars features more than 115 maps, a map editor, head-to-head play via link cable, and an easy-to-understand tutorial mode for beginners.","story":"The story of the Advance Wars begins in the \"Field Training\" tutorial mode, with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the neighboring nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the de facto leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical advisor for the Orange Star Army.\n\nThe player follows the war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, over the course of the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.\n\nAfter winning a battle against Green Earth, Andy gets mysteriously accused by Green Earth's CO, Eagle, of committing a treacherous act of aggression against Green Earth. After defeating the Blue Moon troops that invaded the Orange Star country, the Orange Star Army then invade the Blue Moon country, defeating their troops. The Blue Moon COs, Olaf and Grit, are revealed to be COs whom both used to work for the Orange Star Army, but switched to Blue Moon. When the Orange Star Army's intention was to just pass through the other two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries' COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.\n\nLater on, Green Earth CO Drake tells Eagle that the Orange Star Army didn't attack Green Earth, saying that \"This entire conflict has been orchestrated from the beginning.\" Meanwhile, Yellow Comet CO Sonja and Grit try to discover the person who is really behind the attacks. When Eagle meets Andy again, Eagle again accuses Andy of attacking Green Earth, to which the Orange Star COs eventually convince Eagle that it wasn't Andy who attacked Green Earth. This explains why the three nations have been declaring battles against Orange Star, as they thought Andy attacked them first.\n\nWhen Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja also tells Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying it was someone else, and goes with her to see what she discovered.

Thrilling turn-based strategy gameplay that will put your brain & your reflexes to the test, in this sequel to the original hit!","story":"While the Allied Nations were still recovering from the war in Cosmo Land, the Black Hole Army had already recovered and has decided to launch a large-scale invasion on Macro Land. Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.\n\nOnce the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.\n\nThe Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered. Hawke takes over as leader of Black Hole, and along with Flak, Lash, and Adder, leaves Macro Land with the few troops he has left.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101269,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":4594,"name":"Adventure Island","first_release_date":"09/11/1986","total_rating":67,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","videos":["rvp5Zqi_pzU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3z3x.jpg","description":"Hudson's Adventure Island, also known simply as Adventure Island and released in Japan as Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima (高橋名人の冒険島 lit. \"Master Takahashi's Adventure Island\"), is a side-scrolling platform game produced by Hudson Soft that was first released in Japan for the Famicom and MSX on September 12, 1986.

Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?\", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different.

Someone has planted 24 bombs at famous tourist sites (the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the Acropolis, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, and two cityscapes resembling Miami Beach and Hollywood, which appear only as screen backgrounds rather than unique game locations). Jack must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Jack may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.Bomb Jack's arcade versionJack \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Jack may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups.Bomb Bonuses are triggered when Jack touches the first of 24 onscreen bombs. It is possible to collect the remaining bombs in fuse order, the maximum being 23 (the top score possible on a level). Expert players would combine this with X5 'b's for the largest multiplier score available.The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode, although the onscreen enemies become faster the longer Jack is flying around and they eventually start to follow him at speed. At this point, new enemies appear in the form of flying saucers, that 'lock on' to Jack and are difficult to avoid.Enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \"P\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. The Twin Galaxies highest scores for Bomb Jack on the MAME (arcade) platform are 73,378,560 on marathon settings, and 4,888,740 on tournament settings (5 lives only), achieved by Paul Kearns of London.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101317,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":45662,"name":"Bomber Raid","first_release_date":"12/31/1988","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade","videos":["fItPiRtajJ8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ztpkv2xg3lgylk7nbvqq.jpg","description":"Fly your plane through five levels, shooting enemy planes, submarines, helicopters, and other enemies along the way, and use your equipped cluster bombs if necessary.

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101328,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":2630,"name":"Bubble Bobble","first_release_date":"12/30/1986","total_rating":78,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Strategy","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Strategy, Arcade","videos":["ZVLcmx7kW7s"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3z3p.jpg","description":"In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob.

The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101338,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":11985,"name":"California Games II","first_release_date":"12/30/1990","total_rating":75,"genres":["Racing","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Sport","videos":["lLYemUVpxSU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f79.jpg","description":"Yo Dudes! We're Back... With five new events straight from the land of sand, surf, sunshine, and, or course, some pretty great-looking scenery, too... If you know what we mean.Start out blowing by some stand-ups as you carve a wave on your Bodyboard. It takes lotsa practice to master a barrel roll off the lip. But when you get it down, Wooa! Watch out dudes, it's all over! Dodge a few grommets on the way in to max your score.Once you get your feet wet, be prepared to freeze 'em off as you take on the challenge of Snowboarding. Take the scenic route as you pilot a chopper to the top of the mountain. Parachute down, but watch your height... That 'chute needs time to open, you know! It takes real heavy thrashing to get down in one piece, let alone winning time. On the way down pick up a little bonus time by showing the crowd your stuff in the Snow Bowl.Get majorly amped with Jet Surfing, just about the hottest thing to hit California since sunshine. Snag one of four surf jets and rocket onto the course. Race around the buoys and go for speed, or try a few ramps on for size. Beat the clock or your friends: there's no speed limit on these waters, pal!If you really want to take off, try Hang Gliding. Search for thermals cruising above the coastline. Once you get the hang of it, you can try a few radical stunts just for the heck of it... But blow the landing, and you'll be eating a California cliff burger. Pass the salt, dweeb.Once you've mastered the others, you're ready for the toughest challenge of all... outlaw Skateboarding down the meanest aqueduct on The Coast. Just when you think you've caught the rhythm of the halfpipe, bam!... Everything goes black, and you're corkscrewing through this killer fullpipe. Survive that and it's back into the sunshine in front of the crowd. Oh, by the way, did we forget to mention the concrete wall? Yow! Sorry, dude... to air is human.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101339,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":49192,"name":"Capcom Classics Mini Mix","first_release_date":"10/18/2006","esrb":"T","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xaz41bhqm5g7gvhkivw1.jpg","description":"An action-packed compilation of three of Capcom's most popular titles, originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Dracula's castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.","story":"Taking place in 1830, Circle of the Moon is set in one of the fictional universes of the Castlevania series. The premise of the original series is the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Circle of the Moon's protagonist, however, is Nathan Graves, whose parents died a decade ago to banish Dracula. Morris Baldwin, who helped in Dracula's banishment, trained him to defeat Dracula and the monsters; Morris ultimately chose him as his successor and gave him the \"Hunter Whip\", to the displeasure of Hugh, Morris' son who trained alongside him.\n\nAt an old castle, Camilla, a minion of Dracula, revives him, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Morris, Nathan, and Hugh. Before they are able to banish him again, Dracula destroys the floor under Nathan and Hugh, causing them to plummet down a long tunnel. Surviving the fall and wishing to find his father, Hugh leaves Nathan behind. Nathan proceeds to search the castle for his mentor. Along the way, he learns that at the next full moon, Morris' soul will be used to return Dracula to full power. He also periodically encounters Hugh, who becomes more hostile as the game progresses. Eventually, Nathan encounters Camilla, who hints that she and Dracula are responsible for the changes in his personality. Nathan vanquishes Camilla in her true form and meets up with Hugh once more. Upon seeing him, Hugh immediately attacks him with the goal of proving himself to his father through Nathan's defeat; Nathan, however, realizes that Dracula is controlling Hugh. Nathan defeats him, and Dracula's control over Hugh breaks. Confessing that he doubted his self-worth when Nathan was chosen as successor, Hugh tasks him with Morris' rescue.\n\nArriving at the ceremonial room, Nathan confronts Dracula, who confirms that he had tampered with Hugh's soul to cause the changes in his personality. They begin to fight and halfway through, Dracula teleports away to gain his full power. Hugh then frees his father and tasks Nathan with Dracula's banishment. Nathan continues the battle and defeats Dracula; escaping the collapsing castle, he reunites with Morris and Hugh. Nathan is declared a master vampire hunter by Morris. Hugh vows to retrain under Morris due to his failure.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101350,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance launch title"],"extraDataFull":{"id":"gba39","name":"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon","details":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance launch title"],"igdbId":1132,"gbId":13197,"gbGuid":"3030-13197","tgdbId":3350,"isLaunchTitle":[{"name":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","id":"ccl10","igdbId":24,"gbId":4,"gbGuid":"3045-4","tgdbId":5}],"isExclusive":false,"special":[]}},{"id":1133,"name":"Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance","first_release_date":"06/05/2002","total_rating":76,"esrb":"T","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pih.jpg","description":"Nearly fifty years has past since Simon Belmont rescued the land from the curse of Dracula. Now, Simon's descendant Juste Belmont, must acquire the relics of Dracula to unravel the disappearance of his childhood friend Lydie. The castle's enchanting mysteries and danger await all those who dare enter.","story":"Juste meets Maxim at a castle where Lydie is being held captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, Juste encounters Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, in one of their meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank.\n\nJuste encounters Death again, who explains that the castle has been split in two \"layers\" to accommodate the two spirits living in Maxim's body: his original spirit and an evil one created from Dracula's remains and his suppressed jealousy of Juste. Maxim later confirms this and admits to being Lydie's kidnapper. Juste meets his friend again in the other layer of the castle where he reveals that he lost his memory to protect Lydie. He then gives Juste his bracelet to help him locate her in the castle. However, when Juste finds her, Death kidnaps her to use her blood as a means to unite the two castles by destroying Maxim's spirit. Juste defeats Death, and proceeds to search for Maxim. Along the way, he accumulates Dracula's remains, which are scattered throughout the castle. In the center of the castle, he finds Maxim with an unconscious Lydie.\n\nThree endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, has already bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, Juste escapes the collapsing castle alone and curses his inability to save either friend. In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins the same as the first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession.

The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release.Crash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the sixth game in the main franchise, but it is the first in the Mutant series. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.The game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101383,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":7902,"name":"Croc 2","first_release_date":"06/29/1999","total_rating":64,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Sport","videos":["CdVV7fgVUH8","Yq-hu78AoTk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pps.jpg","description":"Croc 2 is a platformer that follows the cute crocodile protagonist, Croc, in his adventure to free his furry friends the gobbos from the forces of evil.

It has a classic-era Prince of Persia kind of gameplay.Like the other versions, it is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101399,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":49189,"name":"Donald Duck Advance","first_release_date":"12/14/2001","genres":["Platform"],"genresDisplay":"Platform","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ypf.jpg","description":"Search the ends of the world to find and defeat Merlock, rescue Daisy and harness the energy spheres needed to activate Gyro's time machine.*Prevent the quackiest of all heroes from losing his cool and exploding into a laughable frenzy*Master action-packed gameplay through 18 pluse-pounding levels*Play a game that minics a cartoon with vivid graphics wacky characters and zany sound effects","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101400,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1089,"name":"Donkey Kong","first_release_date":"06/13/1994","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Arcade","videos":["QMb6ObDPlXk"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wd9.jpg","description":"Donkey Kong is a Game Boy game which starts out with the premise of being a straight remake of the original Donkey Kong arcade game.

Most of these heads have a time limit before the head returns to normal, with the player able to cancel at any time, though some heads, such as the Pin Head, disable manual cancellation.

You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured. Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-18","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/18/2021","updatedAt":"10/18/2021","_id":101472,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":15535,"name":"Galaga '88","first_release_date":"11/30/1987","total_rating":88,"esrb":"E","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pol.jpg","description":"The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).  With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \"That's Galactic Dancin'!\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \"secret bonus\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \"special bonus\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.  Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \"Warp Capsule\".  At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \"continue\" option to \"on\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Game Gear","consoleId":35,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101473,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":74423,"name":"Game & Watch Gallery 2","first_release_date":"09/26/1997","total_rating":68,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Arcade","videos":["1i8O4oE4fys"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28y7.jpg","description":"Game & Watch Gallery 2 is the sequel to Game & Watch Gallery released in 1997 for the Game Boy, and in 1998 for the Game Boy Color.

Each character has his or her own unique strength and weaknesses. For example, the Warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the Wizard has the most powerful magic, the Valkyrie has the best armour and the Elf is the fastest in movement.  Upon selecting a playable character, the gameplay is set within a series of top-down, third-person perspective mazes where the object is to find and touch the designated exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points and magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen. The enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers and thieves. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no bosses in the game, the most dangerous enemy is \"Death\", who can not only drain a character's health, but is difficult to destroy. As the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently. While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, it also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit (i.e. inserting a coin) within a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":0,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":0,"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101477,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":85795,"name":"Gauntlet Dark Legacy","first_release_date":"11/24/2002","total_rating":72,"esrb":"T","genres":["Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure, Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2i44.jpg","description":"\"Recreated for Game Boy Advance, Gauntlet Dark Legacy is an action-adventure videogame that continues the time-honored “hack-n-slash” style of gameplay where players embark on a mythic quest to save the world.

Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.  By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil magician that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","story":"The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\n\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101484,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":46147,"name":"Golden Axe Warrior","first_release_date":"06/30/1991","genres":["Role-playing (RPG)"],"genresDisplay":"Role-playing (RPG)","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2b8f.jpg","description":"World peace is at stake!

Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.The game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is similar in sound to \"Toccata\", a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky.Gyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits. The game used three microprocessors: two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips and a DAC.Gyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.R.Hirst \"KOO\", M.Jones, \"BOX\" and the Elliott Brother's are arguably considered some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990's.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101501,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":18532,"name":"Ice Hockey","first_release_date":"01/20/1988","total_rating":71,"esrb":"E","genres":["Sport","Hockey"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Hockey","videos":["AAVuhM6r9JE"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wo5.jpg","description":"It's fast skating', hip checkin', high scoring action.

The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101502,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":12153,"name":"Ikari Warriors","first_release_date":"02/28/1986","total_rating":65,"esrb":"E10+","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Arcade","videos":["ED3zyUABUnY","bbnn6gTmfoM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jn1.jpg","description":"A conversion of the arcade game, Ikari Warriors is a vertically scrolling action game.

The gameplay of Jet Set Radio differs in several key areas from its Dreamcast counterpart. Instead of being a 3D game using polygons, the game is a 2D game with an isometric viewpoint. The goal of the game is to traverse through neighborhoods and find key locations to tag them with graffiti under a specific time frame. Players can grind on rails and perform tricks. When a key location is reached, players must tag it with graffiti that may require a single press of a button, or a sequence of buttons that need to be pressed at the correct time. The game offers a graffiti editor to customize and create unique graffiti tags. Players can collect hidden icons scattered throughout in order to expand the number of graffiti tags. After completing the story mode of a specific neighborhood, three new time attack modes are unlocked for that neighborhood. The three modes involve tagging an entire city, racing, and performing tricks. Jet Grind Radio also offers 4-player multiplayer that allows players to compete within the unlocked time attack modes.","story":"Like in the Dreamcast version, the player assumes the role of the GG's, a gang of graffiti-spraying youths, led by Beat (who is also the first playable character).

This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.  You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.  Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.  After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.","story":"IRATA.

It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a point-and-click interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is nonlinear, and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm Games' first self-published product.","story":"The game takes place in the mansion of the fictional Edison family: Dr. Fred, a mad scientist; Nurse Edna, his wife; and their son Weird Ed. Living with the Edisons are two large, disembodied tentacles, one purple and the other green. The intro sequence shows that a sentient meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier; it brainwashed the Edisons and directed Dr. Fred to obtain human brains for use in experiments. The game begins as Dave Miller prepares to enter the mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy Pantz, who had been kidnapped by Dr. Fred. With the exception of the green tentacle, the mansion's inhabitants are hostile, and will throw the player characters into the dungeon—or, in some situations, kill them—if they see them. When a character dies, the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters; and the game ends if all characters are killed. Maniac Mansion has five possible endings, based on which characters are chosen, which survive, and what the characters accomplish.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101536,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":2246,"name":"Marble Madness","first_release_date":"12/30/1984","total_rating":78,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Racing","Strategy","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Puzzle, Racing, Strategy, Arcade","videos":["bTtM0QTKfnc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qnb.jpg","description":"Marble Madness is an isometric platform game in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective.

After Samus' exploits in the Super Nintendo classic Super Metroid, the intergalactic bounty hunter becomes infected with a parasitic life form known only as \"X\". Samus is rescued and revived by Metroid DNA only after undergoing some major changes in her body and suit, resulting in a drastic change in her appearance, and a new ability to absorb and assimilate the abilities of the \"X\" virus. Experience a new and enthralling chapter in the Metroid series, and relive the timeless gameplay and exploration that made the series a legend.","story":"The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologic's research team on planet SR388. Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus's body.\nFeeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship's emergency systems automatically ejected Samus' escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X.\n\nSamus Infected 2\nSamus, infected by the X Parasites.\nThe organic components of Samus's Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus's central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus's chances of survival were lower than one percent.\nMetroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus' dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids' vulnerability to cold.\n\nUpon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship's computer (whom she has named \"Adam\", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected.\n\nSA-X 1\nThe SA-X.\nAs she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus's fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility's Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388.\nAfter the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship's computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for \"peaceful applications\". The computer reveals that the station's SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab's location. Much to Samus's surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station.\n\nLater, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X's destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and \"galactic civilization will end.\"\n\nAs an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station's self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship's computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: \"Don't let them do this. Can't you see what will happen, Adam?\" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus's revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station's orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship's computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death.\n\nSamus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the \"Unnamed Suit\" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus's ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck.\n\nAs Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever.\n\nReflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: \"Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must.\" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: \"we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.\"","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101588,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1102,"name":"Metroid II: Return of Samus","first_release_date":"08/25/1991","total_rating":65,"esrb":"E","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wwx.jpg","description":"A Sinister Planet Threatens the Galaxy!Space Hunter Samus Aran returns to battle a planet crawling with evil creatures bent on universal domination in this bigger than ever sequel to the NES classic, Metroid.Take control!

The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs. Series version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version. Differences between the original and vs. series versions include adding a two-player mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a warp trick in the Royal Palace rooms. In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101598,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["NES hang tab game"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Mighty Bomb Jack","id":"nes261","details":["NES hang tab game"],"igdbId":40531,"gbId":13256,"gbGuid":"3030-13256","tgdbId":1437,"special":[{"value":"NES hang tab game","forPlatform":{"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","id":"ccl1","igdbId":18,"gbId":21,"gbGuid":"3045-21","tgdbId":7}}],"isExclusive":false,"isLaunchTitle":false}},{"id":1658,"name":"Mighty Final Fight","first_release_date":"06/10/1993","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E10+","genres":["Fighting","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","Adventure","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure, Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3c4b.jpg","description":"The Mad Gear Gang has spread crime and violence throughout the streets of Metro City.

Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.Punch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.Little Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.When Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","story":"NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.\nA key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.   GAMEPLAY: The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.  The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.  Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.  Delivering the papers The paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.   In Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. The primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.  Keeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.  The player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.  There are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.  Along the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.  A 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.   Training course Paperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker. The end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.   Finish line bug A bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.  Recapping the delivery The next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.  The game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.  Losing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"  The arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.   PORTS: Paperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.  Unlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.  More recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003. A Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.  Paperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.  An iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Game Gear","consoleId":35,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101640,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":11762,"name":"Paperboy","first_release_date":"03/31/1985","total_rating":66,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Simulator","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Simulator, Arcade","videos":["uvK1jaDoYQs"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qxi.jpg","description":"Paperboy is a 1985 arcade game by Atari Games originally developed in 1984 .

In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.  The player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.  There are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.  Along the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.  A 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.   Training course Paperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker. The end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.   Finish line bug A bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.  Recapping the delivery The next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.  The game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.  Losing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"  The arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.   PORTS: Paperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.  Unlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.  More recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003. A Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.  Paperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.  An iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Sega Master System","consoleId":64,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101642,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":12458,"name":"Paperboy 2","first_release_date":"12/30/1991","total_rating":58,"genres":["Racing","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qxj.jpg","description":"You're a paper boy.

The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The R- in the series title originally stood for \"ray\", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type. his was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\".  The original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN's Top 10 most difficult games to beat. The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot 'em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a 'correct' way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level. The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable 'force' pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).","story":"This is the story of the first encounter with the Bydo, taking place in the year 2163.

The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation.

Several hostages are being held in each stage; Joe must rescue all of them before he is allowed to finish the stage. The last stage in each mission has no hostages, but instead features a powerful boss character whom Joe must defeat. After completing each of the first four missions the player is taken to a bonus stage, where he can earn an extra life if he is able to kill all of the ninjas leaping towards him. Completing the fifth mission ends the game. Also, once the fifth mission begins, continues are no longer allowed; the player has to finish the game with however many lives he has left at that point. If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.Joe's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi's shurikens.[4]Joe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.At the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player's score.","story":"The player controls a ninja named Joe Musashi who has to stop a criminal organization called \"Zeed\" who are kidnapping the children of his ninja clan. Through five missions (consisting of three stages for the first mission and four stages each for the rest), Musashi must make his way to Zeed's headquarters and free all the hostages in the first two or three stages before confronting the boss at the final stage of each mission. At the start of each mission, the player is shown their objective, followed by a file containing a photograph of the enemy boss and a map display pinpointing the location of the next stage.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101695,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":10220,"name":"Shinobi II: The Silent Fury","first_release_date":"12/10/1992","genres":["Platform","Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30it.jpg","description":"Shinobi II: The Silent Fury is a SEGA Game Gear exclusive sequel in the Shinobi series, following up on the original Game Gear Shinobi.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Sega Game Gear","consoleId":35,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101696,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Sega Game Gear exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Shinobi II - The Silent Fury","details":["Sega Game Gear exclusive"],"id":"sgg29","igdbId":10220,"gbId":8666,"gbGuid":"3030-8666","tgdbId":17797,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Sega Game Gear","id":"ccl19","igdbId":35,"gbId":5,"gbGuid":"3045-5","tgdbId":20}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":12267,"name":"Skate or Die","first_release_date":"12/30/1987","total_rating":70,"genres":["Sport","Arcade","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Arcade, Skateboarding","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ynkhrx7lltnrx04dv8is.jpg","description":null,"story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101697,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":48181,"name":"Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble","first_release_date":"09/30/1990","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Skateboarding","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mnze0fp8xkqlo0s6ifes.jpg","description":"The good, the rad, the airborne!

The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.The bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.Every time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.Players are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.

Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds. \n \nThe final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101706,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":6600,"name":"Sonic Battle","first_release_date":"12/03/2003","total_rating":67,"esrb":"E","genres":["Fighting","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Adventure","videos":["xg7jm-zWClM","pgwo0KAyYHo","BgbRuLNbec8"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zvd.jpg","description":"Sonic and pals are gearing up for some brawling action!Fight as one of nine characters including Sonic, Tails and Shadow!Knock 'em dead with special attacks and team-based assaults.Create and train fighting partner for 2-on-2 battles.Duke it out with your friends in 4 player battles.It is the second fighting game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the first being Sonic the Fighters.

After being lost for millennia, the weapon, known as the Gizoid, was unearthed and researched by Professor Gerald Robotnik. It remained dormant for another half century before being discovered by, of all people, Gerald's grandson, Dr. Eggman. Frustrated at his inability to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, Eggman dumped it at Emerald Beach where it was found once more, this time by Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nSonic names the Gizoid \"Emerl\", who gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, both allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, Gamma, Rouge, and Shadow, Emerl turns from a soulless robot into a fun-loving mech with personality traits from all of those he had met. But while the gang is having fun raising their new mechanical friend, there are those who recognize Emerl's true power. Now that Emerl is working again, Eggman has his eye on it, Rouge wants to turn it into a master thief, and Shadow feels that, despite Sonic's efforts to humanize him, Emerl is still a weapon of mass destruction.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101707,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Sonic Battle","details":["Nintendo Game Boy Advance exclusive"],"id":"gba212","igdbId":6600,"gbId":9985,"gbGuid":"3030-9985","tgdbId":3694,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","id":"ccl10","igdbId":24,"gbId":4,"gbGuid":"3045-4","tgdbId":5}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":19538,"name":"Sonic Blast","first_release_date":"10/31/1996","total_rating":42,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ztj.jpg","description":"Fully rendered graphics thrust Sonic into an exciting 3D playing environment.

The player controls Hiryu himself, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.  Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively.  The game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","story":"Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the \"Grandmaster\" rules over the world.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past revives the classic SNES game on the Game Boy Advance and adds a new multiplayer mode. In a Link to the Past, Link travels between the light world and the dark world, conquering fierce monsters and uncovering Hyrule's deepest secrets along the way. Also included is Four Swords, which lets you play with up to three other players, slashing through dungeons and collecting rupees. Whether you choose solo or competitive play, The Legend of Zelda will keep you occupied with its brain-bending puzzles and fun swashbuckling action.","story":"In A Link to the Past\nThe intro to A Link to the Past reveals the back story of the game, showing that series antagonist Ganon was sealed away after his bid for the Triforce. However, the seal has grown weak, and a wizard named Agahnim has taken over the throne of Hyrule, and is kidnapping the seven descendants of the Sages who sealed away Ganon, which includes Princess Zelda. The game opens with series protagonist Link receiving a message from Zelda, telling him to come save her. Following his Uncle, he finds him near death, and is tasked by his Uncle to find and rescue Zelda, giving him his sword and shield before dying. After Link reaches the dungeons, he frees Zelda from her cage, and takes her through a hidden sewer into a Sanctuary, where she remains hidden. The man in the Sanctuary tells Link of Agahnim's plan to break the seal the Sages placed, requiring Link to obtain the Master Sword. Link travels across Hyrule, aided by a man named Sahasrahla, collecting three pendants from the three dungeons, using them to unseal the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. Link returns to Hyrule Castle with the Master Sword after Zelda is kidnapped. When he meets Agahnim, he finds that he is too late, as Agahnim teleports her away.\n\nAfter battling and defeating Agahnim, he takes Link into the Sacred Realm, which has been corrupted and transformed into the Dark World by Ganon. He is tasked with rescuing the seven Maidens who have been sealed away in crystals, as well as finding magical items called the Silver Arrows. Link eventually rescues Zelda, and uses the Maidens' power to break into Ganon's Tower. After fighting and defeating Agahnim for the second time, Ganon flies from Agahnim's corpse into the Pyramid of Power. Link follows, doing battle with him. He eventually defeats Ganon, and finds the Triforce. After the Triforce speaks to Link, Link uses it to wish for Hyrule to return to normal. Afterward, he returns the Master Sword to where he found it. If the player has completed Four Swords, they may find an alternate ending by beating a secret dungeon. This dungeon features four Dark Links, in reference to the four Links in the Four Swords game. After defeating them, an ending showing the inhabitants of the Dark World and the various bosses is shown.\n\nIn Four Swords\nTaking place before the events of Ocarina of Time, the prologue shows Link and Zelda approaching a sword in a pedestal, called the Four Sword. After Zelda explains its history and the creature sealed within it, the creature named Vaati breaks free, capturing Zelda to marry her. Link is encountered by three fairies who instruct Link to pull the Four Sword out. Link pulls the Four Sword out, inadvertently creating three copies of himself that fight alongside him. As the game begins, the four Links are tasked with finding four Great Fairies, who together will grant them access to Vaati's palace. After finding the four Great Fairies and entering the palace the Links battle Vaati. After Vaati is thoroughly weakened, he is trapped in the Four Sword. Zelda and Link return the Four Sword back in its pedestal.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":4,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101803,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1028,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","first_release_date":"06/05/1993","total_rating":83,"esrb":"E","genres":["Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Adventure","videos":["E0ErE4l1EKM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nnt.jpg","description":"A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!Nintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening.

A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint Island where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would leave and travel across the sea. After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens.\n\nLink proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish. After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld.\n\nAfter collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish. This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past.[24] Its final transformation is \"DethI\", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow. After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream. When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear. Link finds himself lying on his ship's driftwood in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish.","player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"consoleName":"Game Boy","consoleId":33,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101804,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1027,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX","first_release_date":"11/30/1998","total_rating":88,"esrb":"E","genres":["Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Adventure","videos":["XORskc95324"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nsg.jpg","description":"Link’s latest challenge is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide.

After Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour and released yearly.Although EA Sports developed most games in the series internally, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the first edition, Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf, which Adrenalin Entertainment developed in conjunction with EA for the PlayStation and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 for the PlayStation, which was developed by Stormfront Studios. IOMO also produced versions of the game for mobile phones for the 2002, 2004, and 2005 editions.In October 2013, EA announced that it would end its relationship with Woods, and be replaced by a new golfer on the next instalment. On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy—the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2]The series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that \"The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around.\"[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro.Contents [hide]1 Games1.1 Original1.1.1 PGA Tour Golf (1990)1.1.2 PGA Tour Golf II (1992)1.1.3 PGA Tour Golf III (1994)1.1.4 PGA Tour 96 (1995)1.1.5 PGA Tour 97 (1996)1.1.6 PGA Tour 98 (1997)1.2 Tiger Woods1.2.1 Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf (1998)1.2.2 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 (1999)1.2.3 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 (2000)1.2.4 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 (2002)1.2.5 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002)1.2.6 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 (2003)1.2.7 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 (2004)1.2.8 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 (2005)1.2.9 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 (2006)1.2.10 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 (2007)1.2.11 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 (2008)1.2.12 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 (2009)1.2.13 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 (2010)1.2.14 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 (2011)1.2.15 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13 (2012)1.2.16 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14 (2013)1.3 Rory McIlroy1.3.1 Rory McIlroy PGA Tour (2015)1.4 Related1.4.1 PGA European Tour (1994)1.4.2 PGA Tour Pro (1997)1.4.3 Tiger Woods PGA Tour (2009)1.4.4 Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online (2010)2 References3 External linksTiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002)[edit]Main article: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003Released in 2002 for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101820,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":4555,"name":"Tiny Toon Adventures","first_release_date":"12/19/1991","total_rating":75,"genres":["Platform"],"genresDisplay":"Platform","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rp2.jpg","description":"Tiny Toon Adventures is a platform video game for the NES.

It is the first entry in the series for the Nintendo DS, and the fifth to appear on Game Boy Advance.  American Sk8land uses cel shaded visuals and it was developed by Vicarious Visions, the developer of the Game Boy Advance Tony Hawk games. The game is based on its console counterpart, American Wasteland, featuring the same soundtrack, many of the same environments, characters.  The top screen is used to display the main gameplay, while the touch screen displays an overhead map of the area the player is currently skating, as well as icons for easily performing tricks. The touch screen is also used to create Skateboard art. Furthering the use of the DS's functions is the ability to record, with the DS microphone, your own sound clips for use in the game.  American Sk8land was the first Nintendo DS game released by a third party to support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the online service for the Nintendo DS. Players are able to play Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo and The Price is Wrong. Players are also able to upload or download graffiti, board art, highscores, and replays to one of the servers, and can periodically download new goals to complete.  In the DS version, the ability to get off the skateboard and walk around was removed; however, this was somewhat balanced by the ability to come to a complete stop and rotate the camera.  The name is shared by the Game Boy Advance version, also created by Vicarious Visions. The GBA version does not share the same graphics, however, having an isometric point of view, polygonal skaters and pre-rendered levels creating a 3D sensation.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101823,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":5231,"name":"Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam","first_release_date":"10/23/2006","total_rating":63,"esrb":"E10+","genres":["Racing","Sport","Strategy"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Sport, Strategy","videos":["2CZOjTzp4J4"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2df5.jpg","description":"Players aim straight downhill at high speed through 7 open locations, such as Machu Picchu, San Fransisco, Rio de Janeiro, Edinburgh, Hong Kong, and more in Tony Hawk's first extreme downhill racing game .

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.","story":"The Peaceful Woods was once the friendly home of sprites and other gentle forest creatures. Wario and his band of monsters invaded, though, and spoiled the serenity of the woods. The quiet, woodlands community has now been turned upside-down by these horrifying events. Wario has now named the woods after himself, and peaceful creatures are not welcome. Toad, the Mushroom Kingdom hero, has decided to travel to Wario's Woods and put an end to Wario's evil reign of terror. Toad knows that, with the sprites help, he will be able to rid the forest of Mario's twisted nemesis. Thankfully, the sprites are able to create bombs. It's Toad's job to line up the bombs with the enemies of the woods, thus defeating those evil creatures. By clearing more and more of the woods, Toad steps ever close to the ultimate challenge of facing Wario.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101841,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1703,"name":"WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!","first_release_date":"03/20/2003","total_rating":88,"esrb":"E","genres":["Sport","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wpz.jpg","description":"Frantic action!

Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking. The big catch with Yoshi Topsy-Turvy is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate. A meter on the upper right corner of the screen shows which way the system is being held at any time. Rotate the system to help Yoshi stay on the path and make it past perils and through the varied stages.Go full tilt!

As Link, you’ll be sent on a treacherous journey to return six precious Crystals to their origins in six stone statues. Only by defeating the guardians of the six palaces will you gain passage to the seventh palace, take on the ultimate challenge that awaits you, and wake the Princess Zelda from her sleeping spell. On your way, helpful villagers you encounter will offer clues and secret messages invaluable in your quest. As you guide Link through the levels of Hyrule, close-ups and overviews will enhance your video vision. Are you up to the challenge?","story":"Several years after the events of The Legend of Zelda, just before his sixteenth birthday, Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, similar to that of the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who responds by taking Link to the tower of North Castle, where a maiden lies in a deep sleep. Impa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda, a princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the \"Legend of Zelda\". A long time ago the Prince of Hyrule had tried to obtain the Triforce, but Zelda refused to tell him the location of it. In order to extract the information from her, he brought in a Magician to interrogate her. Unable to find out any information, the wizard cast a sleeping spell on her, which also resulted in his own death. The prince, being unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened. He decreed that all females born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.\n\nImpa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the chosen hero to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings indicating that each crystal needs to be placed in a different palace in Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage, which has the power to awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon's ashes would supposedly resurrect their master.\n\nUltimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces, and with the crystals in place, the entrance to the Great Palace is opened. After venturing deep inside, Link is made to battle and defeat a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link. After Dark Link is defeated, Link claims the Triforce and uses it to awaken Zelda, who embraces Link while a curtain falls in front of them.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","consoleId":18,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-10-17","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via GBA EverDrive","createdAt":"10/17/2021","updatedAt":"10/17/2021","_id":101858,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":true,"location":"both","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Game Boy Advance","consoleId":24}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":46114,"name":"Zillion II: The Tri Formation","first_release_date":"12/12/1987","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Racing","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dgggrjqoroliml1tihwg.jpg","description":"They're at it again.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.Body Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101888,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Body Harvest","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n6416","igdbId":3426,"gbId":18772,"gbGuid":"3030-18772","tgdbId":244,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":80368,"name":"Bomberman 64","first_release_date":"12/19/2001","total_rating":81,"genres":["Arcade"],"genresDisplay":"Arcade","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25y5.jpg","description":"Not to be confused with the 1997 game known in North America and Europe as \"Bomberman 64,\" this 2D Bomberman title was the last N64 game to be released in Japan.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Bird view / Isometric"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":false},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101889,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3452,"name":"Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!","first_release_date":"12/02/1999","esrb":"E","genres":["Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pll.jpg","description":"Of the great discoveries in the universe, few are more important than the legendary 8 elements.

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.While the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.Bubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.Bust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101896,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3335,"name":"California Speed","first_release_date":"12/31/1997","total_rating":78,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Racing","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co294q.jpg","description":"California Speed features racing through California, with a range of different and unique tracks based on the real life maps of the US state, with short-cuts and branching elements adding elements of strategy when racing to the finish line.The car pool includes the usual collection of fast cars, as well as F1 racers and golf-carts.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101897,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":10608,"name":"Carmageddon 64","first_release_date":"07/24/2000","esrb":"M","genres":["Fighting","Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Racing","videos":["CQxOE-E0HSI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dcr.jpg","description":"Carmageddon 64 was a port of Carmageddon II, released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2000.

The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle.\nDuring the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.\nThroughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega.

The beauty and harmony of the kingdom are protected by seven magical crystals, which sit on the spires of the castle. The wizard is aided in his magic by a pair of magic, four-fingered gloves, which are sentient. One day, though, the wizard accidentally mixes together a bad batch of potions, which create a massive explosion. The mishap turns the wizard into a statue, and sends his magic gloves in two directions—one flies out the window, while the other lands in a cauldron. The explosion also shakes the crystals from the spires, and they hurtle to the ground. The glove that landed outside—Glover—quickly casts a spell to transform the crystals into rubber balls to prevent them from shattering on the ground. They bounce away, entering the magical realms around the kingdom. Without the crystals, though, the world transforms into a foggy, desolate wasteland. To make matters worse, the other glove is corrupted by the potion in the cauldron and becomes the villain, Cross-Stitch.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101950,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3507,"name":"Goemon Mononoke Sugoroku","first_release_date":"12/24/1999","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"genresDisplay":"Card & Board Game","videos":["hg0zt56rctY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f8s.jpg","description":"Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku is a video game for the Nintendo 64, released in 1999.

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.The game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.The World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies.","story":"The game closely follows the plot of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is unexpectedly killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. The MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan.\n\nDuring a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.","player_perspectives":["First person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":101968,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3396,"name":"Jeopardy!","first_release_date":"02/24/1998","total_rating":60,"esrb":"E","genres":["Simulator","Quiz/Trivia"],"genresDisplay":"Simulator, Quiz/Trivia","videos":["Um1EPc8vSoM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co47qv.jpg","description":"This version of Jeopardy features the digitized look and voice of the TV show's host, Alex Trebek and even the announcer, Johnny Gilbert, as well.

While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course.

Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a \"use\" and \"turn around\" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight RPG twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.","story":"In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102008,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":4121,"name":"Mortal Kombat Trilogy","first_release_date":"10/09/1996","total_rating":62,"esrb":"M","genres":["Fighting"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting","videos":["rorKTARyPTM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y26.jpg","description":"Mortal Kombat Trilogy features the same gameplay and story as Mortal Kombat 3, but adds characters and stages from the other three arcade games, including Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

The lord of Oedo asks him to find those who maimed Oedo Castle. Goemon lives in Oedo Town and is friends with Ebisumaru, a strange, gluttonous fat man who wears a blue bandana. Ebisumaru is defined as lazy and perverted. Their kunai-throwing friend Sasuke is a mechanical ninja (made by the Wise Man of Iga) who enjoys hot baths and Japanese tea. Rounding out the heroes is Yae, a fierce sword-wielding kunoichi, who happens upon Goemon's band in Zazen Town. The villains of the game hail from the organization Peach Mountain Shoguns and include a gang of four \"weirdos\" led by Spring Breeze Dancin' (Danshin Harukaze) and Kitty Lily (Margaret Ranko).

The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102037,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":47755,"name":"Nuclear Strike 64","first_release_date":"01/01/2000","genres":["Shooter","Strategy"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Strategy","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zzs.jpg","description":"Nuclear Strike 64 is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay.

It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungsängen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.Participation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102043,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3340,"name":"Paper Mario","first_release_date":"08/10/2000","total_rating":88,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Strategy, Adventure","videos":["N6k5mCj5WmQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qda.jpg","description":"Paper Mario, a turn-based JRPG entry in the Mario franchise with a paper-based aesthetic and platforming elements, sees the titular character working his way through the Mushroom Kingdom's diverse locales and biomes, meeting its inhabitants, fighthing unruly enemies and recruiting an array of companions in order to once again save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Koopa King Bowser.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102044,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":80891,"name":"Paperboy","total_rating":68,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3b8c.jpg","description":"Also called (colloquially) Paperboy 64, this is a 3D reimagining of the classic arcade game.

However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car.

An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core.

Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10]\n\nIn the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir.\n\nEventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102066,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3587,"name":"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2","first_release_date":"10/22/2000","total_rating":50,"esrb":"T","genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Sport","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bpo.jpg","description":"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance.

To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia.

Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In \"The Pirate Treasure Hunt,\" the babies travel underwater in search of items; \"Angelica's Temple of Gloom\" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and \"Reptar Rally\" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102075,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n64110","igdbId":2786,"gbId":21658,"gbGuid":"3030-21658","tgdbId":1196,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":3593,"name":"Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA","first_release_date":"11/09/1998","esrb":"E","genres":["Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Racing","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co39y7.jpg","description":"Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA is a sequel to San Francisco Rush and the second game in the Rush series.The game is notable for the high level of detail in the recreations of the various cities and states used, and for its fast arcade-style physics.

The game itself takes the role as a combat racing game as it features weapons to use against your opposition while racing, and the computers can do the same to you. The game has four modes: Grand Prix, Challenge and Time Attack.  The object of this game is to compete in the Grand Prix and to unlock new tracks and cars. The difficulty of each tournament is determined by which cup you choose to race for. The first cup you race for is the Carbon cup, and once you've beaten that you will unlock other cups that are based on elements like crystal, and diamond. Once you have won a tournament you will unlock a new cup to compete for, new levels to race in, and the chance to challenge other cars to gain access to them for use in Grand Prix races and vs mode.  While Racing you can acquire weapons located around the tracks to help you finish the race quicker or to slow down your opponents so you can overtake them. The combat system is different from many games, except for having health and being destroyed for a limited amount of time, if you or an enemy is hit by a weapon you will be temporarily be slowed downed which gives your opponent time to overtake you. They're some weapons that can be avoided by using your cars jump jets; all cars have jump jets and can be used to avoid certain weapons, however not all weapons can be avoided even with the Jump Jets.  The weapons are: turbo boost, magnets, seeker-style missiles, a boomerang, time bombs, stingers, stoppers, rounds of bullets, and a shield.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102077,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3596,"name":"San Francisco Rush 2049","first_release_date":"12/31/1998","total_rating":70,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Racing","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wo8.jpg","description":"San Francisco Rush 2049 is the third game in the Rush series, sequel to San Francisco Rush and Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA.The game features a futuristic representation of San Francisco and an arcade-style physics engine.

One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.There were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102085,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3343,"name":"Snowboard Kids 2","first_release_date":"02/18/1999","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Sport","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2suf.jpg","description":"The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists.

Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102086,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Snowboard Kids 2","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n64115","igdbId":3343,"gbId":18426,"gbGuid":"3030-18426","tgdbId":1203,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":1257,"name":"South Park","first_release_date":"12/11/1998","total_rating":46,"esrb":"M","genres":["Shooter"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter","videos":["YtWnexGHIng","ujXJmc005cs","8aquXZISjus","c-qD6vvjYVc"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2chc.jpg","description":"Single player takes the form of a \"Story\" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps. The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.","story":"A mysterious comet is approaching the earth; described by the opening narration as a force of concentrated evil that no force of good can stand against.

Yours truly, Princess Toadstool.”\n\n“Wow, an invitation from Peach! I'll head out right away. I hope she can wait for me!”\n\nMario is so excited to receive the invitation from the princess, who lives in the Mushroom Castle that he quickly dresses in his best and leaves right away.\n\n“Hmmm, something's not quite right here... It's so quiet...”\n\nShaking off his uneasy premonition, Mario steps into the silent castle, where he is greeted by the gruff words, “No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha.”\n\nThe sound seems to come from everywhere.\n\n“Who's there?! I've heard that voice somewhere before...”\n\nMario begins searching all over the castle. Most of the doors are locked, but finding one open, he peeks inside. Hanging on the wall is the largest painting he has ever seen, and from behind the painting comes the strangest sound that he has ever heard...\n\n“I think I hear someone calling. What secrets does this painting hold?”\n\nWithout a second thought, Mario jumps at the painting. As he is drawn into it, another world opens before his very eyes.\n\nOnce inside the painting, Mario finds himself in the midst of battling Bob-ombs. According to the Bob-omb Buddies, someone...or something...has suddenly attacked the castle and stolen the “Power Stars.” These stars protect the castle. With the stars in his control, the beast plans to take over the Mushroom Castle.\n\nTo help him accomplish this, he plans to convert the residents of the painting world into monsters as well. If nothing is done, all those monsters will soon begin to overflow from inside the painting.\n\n“A plan this maniacal, this cunning...this must be the work of Bowser!”\n\nPrincess Toadstool and Toad are missing, too. Bowser must have taken them and sealed them inside the painting. Unless Mario recovers the Power Stars immediately, the inhabitants of this world will become Bowser's army.\n\n“Well, Bowser's not going to get away with it, not as long as I'm around!”\n\nStolen Power Stars are hidden throughout the painting world. Use your wisdom and strength to recover the Power Stars and restore peace to the Mushroom Castle.\n\n“Mario! You are the only one we can count on.”","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102103,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":1626,"name":"Super Smash Bros.","first_release_date":"01/20/1999","total_rating":83,"esrb":"E","genres":["Fighting","Platform","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Platform, Sport","videos":["K783SDTBKmg","vX9w2M-6bx0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tso.jpg","description":"Super Smash Bros. is a crossover fighting video game between several different Nintendo franchises, and the first installment in the Super Smash Bros. series.

The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102116,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":6692,"name":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater","first_release_date":"09/28/1999","total_rating":76,"esrb":"T","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Skateboarding","videos":["HrahuUBDQG0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y79.jpg","description":"Take control of real skaters and perform strings of crazy tricks in the first entry of the long-running Tony Hawk skateboarding series.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102117,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":913,"name":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2","first_release_date":"09/19/2000","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Skateboarding","videos":["ADFhiXzBeRg","L7Q4lr4312o"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y77.jpg","description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game.

Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the \"Coyotes,\" they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the \"Vigilantes,\" this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102133,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3333,"name":"Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense","first_release_date":"11/17/1999","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","genres":["Fighting","Shooter"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Shooter","videos":["iwj0PyMn7yU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3b84.jpg","description":"The story of Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense centers on the international meddlings of an oil conglomerate from the future known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime).After finding an electronic armband in a service station bathroom, former Vigilante Slick Clyde rose to be controlled by OMAR.

Taking with him Obake and his cybernetic assassin, Dallas 13, he makes the jump back to 1970s to cripple the United States and bring OMAR to total domination.Appearing in 1970s, the three vehicles encounter Convoy, the former leader of the Vigilantes. Upon seeing him, the three cars open fire.","story":"The game is set in September 1977, two years after the events of Vigilante 8. The southwestern United States has become peaceful in the wake of the Coyotes' defeat, but the Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR) continues to dominate most of the global petroleum market, well into the 21st century. With new Coyotes leader Slick Clyde leading OMAR during the twilight of his life by 2017, Clyde thinks that a failure to conquer America (which has adopted nuclear and sustainable energy) would be his biggest regret. He plans to change history by stealing prototype time machines from Stanford University's quantum physics lab, travel back to the 1970s, and eliminate the Vigilantes to ensure OMAR's supremacy.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":2,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102134,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3334,"name":"Virtual Chess 64","first_release_date":"06/09/1998","esrb":"E","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"genresDisplay":"Simulator, Strategy","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p6xef4pvytuqg3balgpy.jpg","description":"Transform your N64 into a powerful chess adversary.

As Jean-Luc, a covert operative working for the Strategic Covert Actions Team, you are responsible for taking back a Lions-controlled base and regaining power of the satellite. Some of the weapons you'll have to acquire and use to defeat the terrorists are handguns, shotguns, and machine guns, though you'll also need to access such materials as explosives, detectors, flashlights and medical kits in order to succeed. A refreshing take on the traditional action game, WINBACK requires as much stealth and strategy as it does reflexes and use of weaponry.

The development team was able to optimize the usage of the various processors within the N64 to allow far draw distance (reducing the need for fog or pop-up), high detail texturing and models, Doppler effect audio, and advanced lighting and fog effects for realistic weather conditions. Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak. Additionally, unlike many other games of its type on the platform, the game runs high resolution at a sufficiently playable pace, undoubtedly due to the use of a reduced screen area letterbox mode that lessens the number of pixels needing to be displayed.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":102155,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"World Driver Championship","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n64142","igdbId":3642,"gbId":10150,"gbGuid":"3030-10150","tgdbId":414,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":948,"name":"Worms Armageddon","first_release_date":"01/28/1999","total_rating":82,"esrb":"E","genres":["Shooter","Platform","Strategy"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Platform, Strategy","videos":["5kx6giSzl3w"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rkc.jpg","description":"Those intrepid invertebrates return with a vengeance in the much-loved Worms™ Armageddon.
