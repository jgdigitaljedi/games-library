The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.While the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.Bubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.Bust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210036,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3335,"name":"California Speed","first_release_date":"12/31/1997","total_rating":78,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Racing","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co294q.jpg","description":"California Speed features racing through California, with a range of different and unique tracks based on the real life maps of the US state, with short-cuts and branching elements adding elements of strategy when racing to the finish line.The car pool includes the usual collection of fast cars, as well as F1 racers and golf-carts.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":2,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":2,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210038,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":10608,"name":"Carmageddon 64","first_release_date":"07/24/2000","esrb":"M","genres":["Fighting","Racing"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Racing","videos":["CQxOE-E0HSI"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dcr.jpg","description":"Carmageddon 64 was a port of Carmageddon II, released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2000.

The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle.\nDuring the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.\nThroughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega. Ortega has allied himself with Dracula to finally beat Cornell in combat, turning into a chimera like creature. They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers. Unbeknownst to the hero, acquiring this power was the true aim of the dark forces, as it was the perfect sacrifice (not Ada, as Cornell had assumed) to resurrect Dracula at his full power.","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210041,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n6421","igdbId":1131,"gbId":6467,"gbGuid":"3030-6467","tgdbId":246,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":3427,"name":"Chameleon Twist","first_release_date":"11/29/1997","total_rating":59,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Adventure","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dq6.jpg","description":"Chameleon Twist is a 3D-Jump & Run, developed by Japan System Supply and released by Sunsoft in 1997.After following a rabbit into a magical hole in the ground, the blue chameleon named Davy realises that he has taken on a humanoid form.

The game suffered a difficult, prolonged development cycle and was repeatedly delayed until it was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows.

Two government agents appear and abduct Gex to their headquarters, in which Gex is interrogated. The agents explain that Rez has returned and they need his help in taking him down again.

The beauty and harmony of the kingdom are protected by seven magical crystals, which sit on the spires of the castle. The wizard is aided in his magic by a pair of magic, four-fingered gloves, which are sentient. One day, though, the wizard accidentally mixes together a bad batch of potions, which create a massive explosion. The mishap turns the wizard into a statue, and sends his magic gloves in two directions—one flies out the window, while the other lands in a cauldron. The explosion also shakes the crystals from the spires, and they hurtle to the ground. The glove that landed outside—Glover—quickly casts a spell to transform the crystals into rubber balls to prevent them from shattering on the ground. They bounce away, entering the magical realms around the kingdom. Without the crystals, though, the world transforms into a foggy, desolate wasteland. To make matters worse, the other glove is corrupted by the potion in the cauldron and becomes the villain, Cross-Stitch.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210091,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3507,"name":"Goemon Mononoke Sugoroku","first_release_date":"12/24/1999","genres":["Card & Board Game"],"genresDisplay":"Card & Board Game","videos":["hg0zt56rctY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f8s.jpg","description":"Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku is a video game for the Nintendo 64, released in 1999.

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.The game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.The World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies.","story":"The game closely follows the plot of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is unexpectedly killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. The MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan.\n\nDuring a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine.

The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210184,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":47755,"name":"Nuclear Strike 64","first_release_date":"01/01/2000","genres":["Shooter","Strategy"],"genresDisplay":"Shooter, Strategy","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zzs.jpg","description":"Nuclear Strike 64 is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay.

It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungsängen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.Participation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings.","story":null,"player_perspectives":[],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210190,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3340,"name":"Paper Mario","first_release_date":"08/10/2000","total_rating":88,"esrb":"E","genres":["Platform","Role-playing (RPG)","Strategy","Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Platform, Role-playing (RPG), Strategy, Adventure","videos":["N6k5mCj5WmQ"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qda.jpg","description":"Paper Mario, a turn-based JRPG entry in the Mario franchise with a paper-based aesthetic and platforming elements, sees the titular character working his way through the Mushroom Kingdom's diverse locales and biomes, meeting its inhabitants, fighthing unruly enemies and recruiting an array of companions in order to once again save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Koopa King Bowser.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person","Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210191,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":80891,"name":"Paperboy","total_rating":68,"esrb":"E","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3b8c.jpg","description":"Also called (colloquially) Paperboy 64, this is a 3D reimagining of the classic arcade game.

An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core. This greatly weakens the resistance's power and disables Rayman's powers, leading to his capture.[9]\n\nGlobox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship. Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10]\n\nIn the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir.\n\nEventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes. Rayman is presumed dead and only one of his shoes is found, but during his funeral, he appears again, walking on a crutch.","player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210213,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3584,"name":"Razor Freestyle Scooter","first_release_date":"12/10/2000","esrb":"E","genres":["Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Sport","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/g8kcrkjmitljmhaf9vsm.jpg","description":"Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210216,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3587,"name":"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2","first_release_date":"10/22/2000","total_rating":50,"esrb":"T","genres":["Fighting","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Sport","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bpo.jpg","description":"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance.

Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board).

The game has four modes: Grand Prix, Challenge and Time Attack.  The object of this game is to compete in the Grand Prix and to unlock new tracks and cars. The difficulty of each tournament is determined by which cup you choose to race for. The first cup you race for is the Carbon cup, and once you've beaten that you will unlock other cups that are based on elements like crystal, and diamond. Once you have won a tournament you will unlock a new cup to compete for, new levels to race in, and the chance to challenge other cars to gain access to them for use in Grand Prix races and vs mode.  While Racing you can acquire weapons located around the tracks to help you finish the race quicker or to slow down your opponents so you can overtake them. The combat system is different from many games, except for having health and being destroyed for a limited amount of time, if you or an enemy is hit by a weapon you will be temporarily be slowed downed which gives your opponent time to overtake you. They're some weapons that can be avoided by using your cars jump jets; all cars have jump jets and can be used to avoid certain weapons, however not all weapons can be avoided even with the Jump Jets.

One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.There were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210232,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3343,"name":"Snowboard Kids 2","first_release_date":"02/18/1999","total_rating":76,"esrb":"E","genres":["Racing","Sport"],"genresDisplay":"Racing, Sport","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2suf.jpg","description":"The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists.

All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air.

Yours truly, Princess Toadstool.”\n\n“Wow, an invitation from Peach! I'll head out right away. I hope she can wait for me!”\n\nMario is so excited to receive the invitation from the princess, who lives in the Mushroom Castle that he quickly dresses in his best and leaves right away.\n\n“Hmmm, something's not quite right here... It's so quiet...”\n\nShaking off his uneasy premonition, Mario steps into the silent castle, where he is greeted by the gruff words, “No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha.”\n\nThe sound seems to come from everywhere.\n\n“Who's there?! I've heard that voice somewhere before...”\n\nMario begins searching all over the castle. Most of the doors are locked, but finding one open, he peeks inside. Hanging on the wall is the largest painting he has ever seen, and from behind the painting comes the strangest sound that he has ever heard...\n\n“I think I hear someone calling. What secrets does this painting hold?”\n\nWithout a second thought, Mario jumps at the painting. As he is drawn into it, another world opens before his very eyes.\n\nOnce inside the painting, Mario finds himself in the midst of battling Bob-ombs. According to the Bob-omb Buddies, someone...or something...has suddenly attacked the castle and stolen the “Power Stars.” These stars protect the castle. With the stars in his control, the beast plans to take over the Mushroom Castle.\n\nTo help him accomplish this, he plans to convert the residents of the painting world into monsters as well. If nothing is done, all those monsters will soon begin to overflow from inside the painting.\n\n“A plan this maniacal, this cunning...this must be the work of Bowser!”\n\nPrincess Toadstool and Toad are missing, too. Bowser must have taken them and sealed them inside the painting. Unless Mario recovers the Power Stars immediately, the inhabitants of this world will become Bowser's army.\n\n“Well, Bowser's not going to get away with it, not as long as I'm around!”\n\nStolen Power Stars are hidden throughout the painting world. Use your wisdom and strength to recover the Power Stars and restore peace to the Mushroom Castle.\n\n“Mario!

It is also available as a mode in Ocarina of Time 3D after first completing the regular game.It was previously developed to be released as an expansion to the original game, via the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive, but that version was cancelled due to the lackluster sales of the hardware.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210123,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3339,"name":"The New Tetris","first_release_date":"07/30/1999","esrb":"E","genres":["Puzzle"],"genresDisplay":"Puzzle","videos":null,"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3a6w.jpg","description":"There are several key differences in gameplay from the original Tetris. First, in addition to clearing lines, one can also form 4x4 large squares of four pieces to form 'blocks'. When a block is created, it turns solid gold or silver, depending on the makeup of the block—a block built from all the same kind of piece becomes a golden block or \"monosquare\", while any other combination becomes a silver block or \"multisquare\". Blocks can only be constructed from whole pieces: if any part of a piece has been cleared, then it cannot be used to form a block. When a line that has pieces from a block is cleared, it earns more points.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Side view"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210183,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"extraDataFull":{"name":"The New Tetris","details":["Nintendo 64 exclusive"],"id":"n64124","igdbId":3339,"gbId":1737,"gbGuid":"3030-1737","tgdbId":1161,"isExclusive":[{"name":"Nintendo 64","id":"ccl3","igdbId":4,"gbId":43,"gbGuid":"3045-43","tgdbId":3}],"isLaunchTitle":false,"special":[]}},{"id":19421,"name":"The Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-Traction","first_release_date":"10/03/2001","esrb":"E","genres":["Fighting","Platform"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Platform","videos":["1ouo2IARJGM"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f14.jpg","description":"Join the Powerpuff Girls to stop the villains from eating their Chemical X pie in an action packed adventure.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210203,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3613,"name":"Tigger's Honey Hunt","first_release_date":"09/28/2000","esrb":"E","genres":["Adventure"],"genresDisplay":"Adventure","videos":["dGVA7yrZswY"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bpr.jpg","description":"Winnie the Pooh needs YOU!

The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210258,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":6692,"name":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater","first_release_date":"09/28/1999","total_rating":76,"esrb":"T","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Skateboarding","videos":["HrahuUBDQG0"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y79.jpg","description":"Take control of real skaters and perform strings of crazy tricks in the first entry of the long-running Tony Hawk skateboarding series.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210259,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":913,"name":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2","first_release_date":"09/19/2000","total_rating":86,"esrb":"E","genres":["Sport","Skateboarding"],"genresDisplay":"Sport, Skateboarding","videos":["ADFhiXzBeRg","L7Q4lr4312o"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y77.jpg","description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game.

Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the \"Coyotes,\" they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the \"Vigilantes,\" this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.","story":null,"player_perspectives":["Third person"],"multiplayer_modes":{"offlinemax":4,"offlinecoopmax":0,"splitscreen":true},"maxMultiplayer":4,"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4,"condition":"other","case":false,"pricePaid":0,"physical":false,"cib":false,"datePurchased":"2021-11-05","howAcquired":"piracy","notes":"playable via EverDrive 64","createdAt":"11/05/2021","updatedAt":"11/05/2021","_id":210275,"physicalDigital":["EverDrive"],"manual":false,"handheld":false,"location":"upstairs","compilation":false,"compilationGamesIds":[],"gamesService":{"xbGold":false,"xbPass":false,"psPlus":false,"primeFree":false,"switchFree":false},"consoleArr":[{"consoleName":"Nintendo 64","consoleId":4}],"vr":{"vrOnly":false,"vrCompatible":false},"extraData":[],"extraDataFull":[]},{"id":3333,"name":"Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense","first_release_date":"11/17/1999","total_rating":80,"esrb":"T","genres":["Fighting","Shooter"],"genresDisplay":"Fighting, Shooter","videos":["iwj0PyMn7yU"],"image":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3b84.jpg","description":"The story of Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense centers on the international meddlings of an oil conglomerate from the future known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime).After finding an electronic armband in a service station bathroom, former Vigilante Slick Clyde rose to be controlled by OMAR.

Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak.
